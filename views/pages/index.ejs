    I love The Legend of Dragoon and wish to keep this content alive. I am also
    planning on a complete rework, making it modern and adding much more.

    Here is a post from the original website saying she will no longer maintain the website:
    Updates: 2-5-09

    All right peeps, here's the throw down:

    I will no longer be updating this website.

    Fact of the matter is, I've moved on with my life. I have BIGGER GOALS I've set my sights on and frankly speaking there is no longer any time for me to freely devote to this website or the game.

    Endiness the Land of Dragoons will still be around, but I will be doing other things. Thanks to all who gave support and content through the years (this will be EtLoD's eighth year!) and I wish you all happy adventuring in your life!

    Take care,
    Malk

        <p><h2><u>Welcome to Endiness, the Land of Dragoons!</u></h2>

        <p><u>Update: 05-18-18</u>

        <p>Hey all,</p>

        <p><a>thelegendofdragoon.net</a> is no longer being maintained so I, a fan of The Legend of Dragoon who's thankful for the site's helpful content, decided to copy the site over to a new host.</p>

        <p>All credit is due to the original creator (Malk?). The html and images were copied over into a Node + Express app. I am planning on a complete rework, making it modern and adding much more, including archiving everything related to this wonderful game. I will keep this classic site available as a section of the new site. I may add social features (forums possibly), and any good suggestions!</p>

        <p>I want to help the community maintain this legendary game. If you have any suggestions please email me at <a href="mailto:bruce@bitbruce.com">bruce@bitbruce.com</a>.</p>

        <p>Enjoy,<br/>Bruce</p>
