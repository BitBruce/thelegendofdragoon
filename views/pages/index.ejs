    planning on a complete rework, making it modern and adding much more.

    Updates: 2-5-09

    All right peeps, here's the throw down:

    I will no longer be updating this website.

    Fact of the matter is, I've moved on with my life. I have BIGGER GOALS I've set my sights on and frankly speaking there is no longer any time for me to freely devote to this website or the game.

    Endiness the Land of Dragoons will still be around, but I will be doing other things. Thanks to all who gave support and content through the years (this will be EtLoD's eighth year!) and I wish you all happy adventuring in your life!

    Take care,
    Malk
