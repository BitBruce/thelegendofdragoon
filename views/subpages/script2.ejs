<p><i>Lloyd enters Furni.  Time stands still as he turns around and disappears.</i>

<p><h2><b><u>Chapter 2:  The Platinum Shadow</h2></b></u>

<p><i>Shana runs into Furni, turns and beckons Dart, Albert, Rose, and Haschel to come in.</i>

<p><font color="#3399FF">Shana: I smell... the ocean from this river!</font>
    <br><i>Dart looks closely at the bridge</i>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: It's close to the sea. <i>Turns to Dart</i> Is anything wrong with the bridge? </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: It says "Claire Bridge". It's the same name as my mom. </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Oh! My runaway daughter is named Claire, too!  There may be some secret connection between us! </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: <i>(Shrugs)</i> It's impossible to have such a coincidence. </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: I agree with you. Let's say the population of Endiness Continent is about 1,000,000 and 550,000 are women. According to the statistics of the Royal Personnel Authority, 4% of all women have the name Claire. It means from a statistical point of view.... </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: Just looking tells it all. They don't look like each other at all. </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Hmmm, indeed. <i>Goes up to Dart and Haschel</i> Cranioscopically speaking, the distance between their skull, eyeballs and also their jawbones are.... </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: Let's go. He won't finish talking until dusk. </font>

<p><i>They leave</i>

<p>People:  Yeek!!  <i>(They run away from the town square)</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: !? </font>

    <br><i>(Albert leaves to get a better look)</i>

<p><i>In town square</i>
    <br>Townsman: Shoot, Pri, Princess Emille is here!!
    <br>People:  (Begin running around)
    <br>Man: It's too sudden!!
    <br>Boy: It's scary!
    <br>Man: Gods, please help us through this....
    <br><i>Princess Emille enters from stairway</i>
    <br>Emille:  I heard somebody say "Shoot".  Who said that!?  <i>(Looks at man, woman, boy, and dog.  The dog runs away.)</i>  Hey, I'm the princess in this country!  You have to be nice to me!  <i>(Continues looking around, and a pregnant mother approaches.  Emille turns to her.)</i>
    <br>Pregnant Mother: Ex, Excuse me your highness, I would like you to name by soon-to-be-born baby....
    <br>Emille: <i>(Gets in the woman's face)</i> I don't think so.  It's a hell on wheels.
    <br>Pregnant Mother: (Covers face in hands)</i>  Oh no!
    <br>Emille:  <i>(Throws her hand out)</i> Disgusting!!  Stop crying!!
    <br>Pregnant Mother:  Since my husband was killed by bandits....This, this baby has been my only hope.
    <br>Emille: <i>(Backs off)</i> Bandits!? <i>(Turns around)</i> Phooey!  You bore me!!  <i>(Leaves)</i>
    <br>Pregnant Mother: <i>Goes after Emille, but is blocked by a guard)</i> Oh no!

<p><i>Back to Dart and Albert</i>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: <i>(Falls to his knees)</i> Is, is that person Princess Emille?  I heard that she was very sweet.  Oh no...if this is a dream, please wake me up! <i>(Goes back to Dart)</i></font>

<p><i>Dart and the others enter the bar</i>
    <br>Kaffi: <i>(Runs up to Dart)</i> Welcome!!  Come on in!!  All the way to the back!!  <i>(Dart looks around at the very small bar)</i>  Oh, such slow pokes! <i>(Pushes Dart into a table.  Everyone takes a seat.)</i>  She looks around at them You guys are from out of town, aren't ya!?

<p><i>Answer to "No, we are from here."</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: No, we are from here.</font>
    <br>Kaffi: <i>(Runs up to him)</i> You, liar!!  You don't look like you are form here!!  Liar!!
    <br>Bartender:  Hey!!  Kaffi!! <i>(Kaffi turns to him)</i> Don't start up a fight with customers!!
    <br>Kaffi:  Okay. <i>(Turns back to Dart)</i> Sorry.  I gotta go back to work. (But why don't ya come back later.  I have lots of things to tell ya.  Besides, actually, we're not that busy.)

<p><i>Kaffi leaves, and everyone joins Dart</i>

<p><i>When Dart goes back to the bar</i>
    <br>Kaffi:  Hey, you wanna talk some more?  To the back, pleaee!  I know you guys are actually from out of town!  <i>(Everyone takes a seat around a table  Kaffi walks up to Dart)</i>

<p><i>Answer to "Yes, we are."</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Nods)</i> Yes, we are.</font>
<p>Kaffi:  I knew it!  I could immediately tell you are not from here.  <i>(Walks up to Dart)</i>  You guys....Mmmm, mmmm!  Smell like exotic foreigners!  Let m give ya a quick introduction to this town!!  <i>(Walks away from Dart)</i> You saw lots of star shapes in this down didn't ya?  There were decorations on top of roofs or mosaics on the street, right?  It's 'cuz Tiberoans have faith in the stars.  <i>(Walks up to the table)</i>  Naturally, we have an advanced astronomy.
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  It's the study of stars isn't it? <i>(Kaffi turns to her)</i> Sounds wonderful. </font>
    <br>Kaffi: <i>(Nods)</i> Right!?
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: <i>(Turns to Dart and Shana, who both turn to him)</i> (We are here to pursue Lloyd!) </font>
    <br>Kaffi: <i>(Walks over to them)</i> Whadayasay?  What are you two guys whispering about?  Are you becoming more interested in stars?

<p><i>Answer to "Yes, we are."</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Nods)</i> Yes, we are.</font>
    <br>Kaffi: Really!?  To tell ya the truth, I love to talk about stars with people from out of town while working at this here bar!  <i>(Walks up to Dart)</i> Well, the stars are beyond the sky!  They are way over the clouds!  They are bright although they are far away. Cuz each of the stars has a lighthouse on it.  Cuz they have a lighthouse, they never get lost in the sky!  And, and!
    <br>Bartender:  Hey!!  Kaffi!!  <i>(Kaffi turns to him)</i> Don't give the customers hard time!!
    <br>Kaffi:  Okay.  <i>(Turns back to Dart)</i>   Sorry.  I gotta go back to work. (But why don't ya come back later.  I have lots of things to tell ya.  Besides, actually, we're not that busy.)

<p><i>Kaffi leaves, and everyone joins Dart</i>

<p><i>Dart enters the bar again</i>
    <br>Kaffi: You wanna talk to me some more?  It's okay now, cuz my boss's not looking at us.  Come on!  All the way to the back!  I know.  Actually you want to ask about something other than stars.

<p><i>Everyone takes a seat around a table</i>

<p><i>Answer to "I'm sorry, but...."</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Shakes head)</i> I'm sorry, but....We are actually looking for a man named Lloyd. </font>
    <br>Kaffi: <i>(Backs away from him)</i>  A "man"?  Are you more interested in a man than stars!?  <i>(Shrugs and runs up to them)</i> Just kidding!
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Yup.  We are looking for a man named Lloyd. </font>
    <br>Kaffi:  <i>(Walks away a bit)</i> Hmm, Lloyd?  <i>(Walks around some more, then turns to Dart and shrugs)</i> I dunno, if Miss Kaffi the hipster doesn't know it means he probably isn't in this town <i>(Walks up to them a bit)</i>  Are you sure you still interested in hearing about stars?

<p><i>Answer to "Uh huh".</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Uh huh. </font>
    <br>Kaffi:  Sorry...I only know things that everybody else knows.  <i>(Walks around a bit, then turns back to Dart)</i>  You know what!  I'll introduce you to a person you would like!! <i>(Takes a step forward)</i> He's an astronomer named Fester!  He is crazy about the Moon That Never Sets.  I think he can tell you lots of interesting things
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Shrugs)</i> The Moon That Never Sets? </font>
    <br>Kaffi: <i>(Nods)</i> You know, the one over there.  The strange star in the sky all the time, day or night.  I heard he is doing research aobut the relationship between a monster called the Black whachamacallit and the Moon That Never Sets.
<p><i>Everyone turns to each other and nods</i>
    <br>Kaffi:  Why don't you drop by?  He's next door.
    <br>Bartender:  Hey!!  Kaffi!!  <i>(Kaffi turns to him)</i> Stop goofing around!!  It's already dark outside!!
    <br>Kaffi:  Okay.  <i>(Turns to Dart)</i> Sorry, I gotta go back to work.  <i>(Runs off)</i>

<p><i>Answer to "I don't think so."</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Shakes head)</i>  I don't think so.</font>
    <br>Kaffi:  <i>(Runs up to him)</i> I knew from the start that you actually didn't want to listen to me!!  I know you actually don't like to talk!!
    <br>Bartender:  Hey!!  Kaffi!!  <i>(Kaffi turns to him)</i>  Don't get into it with the customers!!
    <br>Kaffi:  Okay. <i>(Turns back to Dart)</i> Sorry.  I gotta go back to work. (But why don't ya come back later.  I have lots of things to tell ya.  Besides, actually, we're not that busy.)

<p><i>Dart enters the bar, Kaffi runs up to them</i>
    <br>Kaffi:  Welcome!!  Come on in!!  All the way to the back!!  <i>(Looks around at the very small bar)</i>  Oh, such slow pokes!
    <i>(Pushes Dart into a table.  Everyone takes a seat.  She looks around at them)</i>

<p><i>Entire conversation starts over</i>

<p><i>At Fester's House...</i>

<p><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  This must be the house next door.  I wonder if Mr. Fester is in?  <i>(Dart rings doorbell, but no one answers)</i> Maybe not? </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  The lights are on though. </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  Let me see!  <i>(Shana goes up to the door and rings the doorbell)</i>  Mr. Festeeeer!!  Are you hooome!? </font>
    <br>Fester: <i>(From inside)</i>  Yes, yes I am!!  <i>(Opens door)</i>  Sorry!  I wasn't paying attention.  I was admiring the moon!  Come on in!  Please, let's talk inside.

<p><i>Inside Fester's house</i>

<p><font color="#990000">Dart:  We are here to ask you about the Moon That Never Sets. </font>
    <br>Fester: <i>(Nods)</i>  Oh!  About the Moon That never Sets!  Wait here for a minute.  Let me get some materials.  <i>(Walks away and kneels in front of a shelf)</i> You are interested in a weird matter.  <i>(Gets up and walks back over to them)</i>  Of course, I cannot make judgements about other people.   <i>(Holds out a book)</i> Please take a look at this.

<p><i>(Shana and Dart walk up to book, scene plays...)</i>

<p>Fester:  In astronomy, a Moon That Never Sets cannot exist.
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Cannot exist? </font>
    <br>Fester:  That's right.  Stars travel the sky by catching the winds of time.  But this moon isn't affected by time.  It never moves day or night.  That's why it's called the Moon That Never Sets.  <i>(Pauses)</i> After counting 108 years, when the Moon That Never Sets glows red, a Moon Child descends upon the earth to fill the world with holy bliss, a poem of yore telling the fate given by the name.  However, what we really get is the spawning of destruction and fear that is the Black Monster.
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  The Black Monster...</font>
    <br><i>Pause</i>
    <br>Fester:  Why a demon, not a blessing?  What does it mean?  The mystery has yet to be resolved...

<p><i>(Scene ends)</i>

<p><i>Dart nods</i>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  <i>(Fester turns to him)</i> I never imagined we would be able to get some information on the Black Monster here.  </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Nods)</i></font>
    <br>Fester:  <i>(Turns back to Dart.</i>  Did you find this useful?
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  Yes!  You think so too, right Dart? </font>
    <br><i>Dart turns to Shana and nods, then Fester nods</i>
    <br>Fester:  Very good.  It is a pleasure to be helpful to such a beautiful young lady.

<p><i>Answer to "Ignore"</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Crosses arms)</i> (Ignore.)  <i>(Unfolds arms)</i></font>

<p><i>Answer to "You said who is beautiful?"</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(scratches head)</i> You said who is beautiful? </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  Hey!  </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:<i>(Dart turns to her)</i> I guess there are many ways to see things. </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  <i>(Walks up to him and begins hitting him, Dart holds out his arms in defense)</i> Whatever!  <i>(She continues hitting him)</i></font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Stop it! </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: <i>(nods)</i> Having a good friend is beautiful.  It makes me envious. </font>


<p><i>(Bell rings, everyone looks around)</i>
    <br>Fester:  Oh, it's getting late!  I have to hurry up or I will be making the Princess wait!  <i>(Runs over to his stuff and gathers items)</i>  It's hard to eat only by astronomy.  I'm acting as the governor or Princess Lisa as well.  <i>(Runs back over to Dart and Shana)</i>  Oh, if you want to take a good look at the Moon That Never Sets, go upstairs and take a look through the telescope.  It's set in the direction of the Moon That Never Sets. Now, I am heading to the castle.   <i>(Leaves)</i>

<p><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Dart looks into telescope)</i>This is the Moon That Never Sets.  </font>

<p><i>At Nello's place, they all enter</i>

<p>Nello:  Welcome.  I am Nello, the representative of the Green Project, turning the brown barrens to green, the deserts to forest.  <i>(Looks around at them)</i>  Don't be shy.  You too whish to bring green back to the earth don't you??

<p><i>Answer to "Actually not"</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Shakes head)</i> Actually not. </font>
    <br>Nello:  Oh, I see.  I won't force my opinion on you.  But if you change your mind please drop by anytime.
    <br><i>(Dart nods and they leave)</i>

<p><i>They enter again</i>

<p>Nello:  Welcome back.  Actually, you were thinking about bringing green back to earth weren't you?

<p><i>Answer to "Yes, we do."</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(nods)</i> Yes, we do. </font>
    <br>Nello:  I thought so!  But, it's already late.  It'll take a whole night to explain my plan.
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Turns to others and scratches head)</i>  A whole night, hmm!?  But actually, it's ok with us isn't it? <i>(Everyone except Rose nods, Dart turns back to Nello)</i> We were in trouble because there was nowhere to stay for the night.  We are not allowed to leave town either.  </font>
    <br>Nello:  I see!  I have plenty of time to tell you about the Green Project tonight then!
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: <i>(Walks up to Nello)</i>  The re-vegetation of the desert is a very interesting issue.  </font>
    <br>Nello:  Right!  In principle, the relationship between Humans and the earth should be!
    <i>(Nello and Albert begin chatting.  Shana walks over to a flower pot.  Dart crosses his arms, unfolds them, then walks over to her)</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Watching the buds? </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: <i>(Jumps up, startled)</i>  Maybe...they are some kind of glower buds.  I've never seen anything like this....I wonder how they bloom. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  You are excited about it, aren't you?  <i>(Shana nods.  He turns away from her)</i> Talking about buds.  You've always liked to see flowers blooming. </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: <i>(Nods)</i> You remember that.... </font>
    <i>(Dart turns to her and nods)</i>
    <br>Nello:  Humans should grow up surrounded by greenery.
    <i>(Dart turns to Nello and Albert)</i>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  Exactly.  Green not only gives peace of mind but brings us marvelous things. </font>
    <br>Nello:  Fruits, vegetables, delicious air.  All are brought by greenery. </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  I guess they really will talk until morning. </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  The king has such curiosity....</font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Turns to Shana)</i> I hope we can fill Seles with green some day. </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: <i>(Nods)</i> Yes. </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  The issue here is how to promote the greening.
        <br>Nello:  That's the key issue.  The research requires a lot of money. </font>

<p><i>Night passes.  The next day, the group exits the city</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Turns to the others)</i>  There are no signs of Lloyd after all.  </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  <i>(Folds arms and shakes head)</i>  I cannot imagine that Emperor Doel told us a lie. </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: <i>(Walks up to Dart)</i>  In his last moment, my uncle was himself again.  I think we can trust the information that Lloyd headed for Tiberoa.  So we should assume that we crossed paths with Lloyd. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Turns away and lowers his head, shaking it)</i>   So, where in the world? </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  In any case, <i>(they all turn to her)</i>  the king is getting along with a motley crew like us. </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Throws his hands in the air, Dart turns to him)</i> I was concerned at first.  I even imagined that we were going to be pushed around by the King's ego. </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: <i>(Shakes head, and the others turn to him)</i> Please, stop teasing me, both of you!  What I would like you to do is just treat me as an equal, as a friend traveling together.  </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: <i>Walks up to Dart)</i>  Dart is not good at speaking with courtesy.  He gets cramps in his tongue when he tries for a long time.  </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Scratches head and turns to Albert)</i>  I appreciate your solicitude, Your Majesty. </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  <i>(Shakes head)</i>  Let's stop using that "Your Majesty".  We will be in trouble if anyone hears that.  <i>(He takes a step forward)</i> Anyway, the priority is to pursue Lloyd.  <i>(Nods, and turns to Dart)</i>  This is not the only town in Tiberoa.  If my memory is correct, there should be a town called Donau along the north sea shore.  </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  <i>(Runs over to Dart)</i>   Let's go there now! </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Nods, starts to head out, then turns to the others and throws his fist in the air)</i>   Okay!  Let's leave as soon as possible! </font>

<p><i>In the Barrens, they approach a small rock bridge and hear laughter</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  !!  <i>(Looks on top of the bridge)</i></font>
    <br>Mappi:  Hee Hee Hee!!  Are you dating those girls in a place like this!?
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>Walks up to him and puts his hands on his hips)</i>   Who are you?</font>
    <br>Mappi:  Hee hee hee!!  Did you hear that?  They are asking us "who we are"!!
    <br>Gehrich Gang A: <i>(Turns to Mappi)</i>  I guess they think we are a bunch of doctors!!
    <br>Gehrich Gang B:  <i>(Turns to Mappi)</i> Should be a quack!!  Ha ha ha!!
    <br><i>They all jump off the bridge and hold out their weapons to Dart and the others</i>
    <br>Mappi:  Surprise, surprise!!  We are the one and only Gehrich Gang!!  We're so bad we scare ghosts back to hell!!
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Shakes head</i>  They have no class. </font>
    <br>Gehrich Gang A:  Hey, what did you say?!! <i>(Turns to Mappi)</i> Yo Mappi!!  How should I cook these dumbheads!?
    <br>Mappi:  Well, hmmm.  I know what!!  Let's get our reward of money and the bimbos!
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: <i>(Walks up to Mappi)</i>  We have nothing to give you.  But if you insists, how about a "miserable ending" for you? </font>
    <br>Mappi:  Stop yapping like that!  Just leave your valuables.  It's that simple!
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Draws his sword)</i>  Get out of our way.  We don't have time to play with you. </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  <i>(Draws her sword)</i> This is your last chance.  Get out of our way or you'll need a real doctor. </font>
    <br>Mappi:  Gwa...!  ARRGGGH!!!  I'm totally pissed!!  Smash their heads will ya, brother!?

<p><i>Gehrich Gang screams, battle begins</i>

<p><i>After battle</i>

<p><i>Dart goes in for final blow, Mappi backs up</i>

    <br>Mappi:  H, hold.  <i>(Stands up and begins jumping)</i> Wow!  <i>(Falls to his knees)</i>  It's..It's my fault!  <i>(Folds hands together)</i>  I won't do it again.  Please forgive me!  <i>(Falls to his knees again, then tilts his head up)</i>  Just kidding.

<p><i>Mappi attacks Dart and knocks away Dart's Dragoon Spirit.  Both Mappi and Dart dive for the Dragoon Spirit, but Mappi gets a hold of it and rolls away from Dart</i>

<p>Mappi:  <i>(Looks at Dragoon Spirit)</i>  What's this?

<p><i>Rose runs after him, but he dodges all of her attacks and leaps away.  He kneels atop of a rock, laughs, and runs away with Dart and Rose looking in his direction</i>

<p><i>Dart, Haschel, Shana, Albert, and Rose all try to follow Mappi but they lose sight of him</i>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  He's gone. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Clenches his fist)</i>  It's my fault for not being careful enough! </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  <i>(Shakes her head)</i>  A Dragoon Spirit being stolen is the last thing I wanted to have happen. </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  <i>(Shrugs)</i>  Anyway, let's move on to Donau.  We might find out something about the Gehrich Gang when we get there. </font>

<p><i>Dart nods and they all leave</i>

<p><i>In the city of Donau, a little girl walks up to them</i>

    <br>Little girl:  Wel, Welcome to Donau the Flower City.
    <br><i>Dart scratches his head and nods</i>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  Thank you. </font>
    <br>Little girl:  Thank god!  <i>(Walks away then turns to them)</i> You don't look like bandits!  Your clothes are so filthy that at first I thought you might be! <i>(Little girl leaves)</i>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  We really are covered in dust.  It's natural the girl would be mistaken. </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  <i>(Looks down at her clothes, then up at Dart)</i>  Don't stare at me like that! </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Shrugs)</i>  It's not that bad. </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose.  <i>(Everyone turns to her)</i> We don't have time for fooling around like that. </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Walks up to Rose)</i>  Are you jealous? </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: <i>(Throws her hair back, then walks ahead through them)</i>  I am just concerned about the Dragoon Spirit. </font>

<p><i>Meanwhile, in another part of town, three bandits are chasing a young woman</i>

    <br>Woman:  Noooo!  <i>(The bandits corner her)</i>  What are you going to do!?
    <br>Bandit A:  We are deciding now!  <i>(Walks up to her)</iu>  Hee Hee Hee....As I expected.  You are one of the Sacred Sisters of Mille Seseau aren't ya!?  You have such a pretty face, don't you!?
        <br></i>Bandits cheer</i>
    <br>Bandit B:  Great!  Selling her will make us rich!
    <br>Bandit C: <i>(Walks up to her and pulls out his knife)</i> Don't make a noise and we won't harm you!!
    <br>Woman:  <i>(Kneels)</i>  Some, somebody help!!!  <i>(Bandits close in, and Lloyd enters.  The woman turns to him)</i>  Oh, Gentleman over there!!  P, please....
    <br><i>Bandits turn to Lloyd</i>
    <br>Bandit A:  Just go away!  Or you'll be sorry!
    <br><i>Lloyd begins to walk away, then pulls out his sword</i>

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd:  If you don't mind dying. </font>
    <br>Bandit A:  <i>(Bandit A shakes his head, and then his lackeys follow him over to Lloyd)</i> YOU are the one to die!!  <i>(Goes to attack Lloyd, but gets blown away)</i> Argh!!
    <br><i>Bandits B and C look between Bandit A and Lloyd</i>
    <br>Bandit B:  Wh, What did you do!?
    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd:  <i>(Swings his sword)</i> Shall I continue? </font>
    <br>Bandits: Ahhh!!! <i>(Bandits flee)</i>
    <br><i>The young woman stands up and goes after Lloyd as he leaves)</i>
    <br>Woman:  P, Please wait!!  I don't know who you are, but thank you very much for helping me!
    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd:  It's nothing. </font>
    <br>Woman:  <i>(Takes a step towards him)</i>  Oh, please, let me at least have your name!!
    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd:  <i>(Turns to her)</i>  It's Lloyd.</font>
    <br>Woman:  My, my name is Wink!  I am a Sacred Sister of Mille Seseau!! <i>(Lloyd waves at her, then leaves)</i>  Oh, Lloyd.

<p><i>In Kate's house, she is talking to herself as Dart and the others enter</i>

    <br>Kate:  Oh why, did you go Lynn?  We are having a wedding soon.  It's impossible to have a talk with the Gehriches.  <i>(Turns to Dart)</i>  Who...who are you!?
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Holds hands up)</i>  Don't worry.  We are not bandits.  </font>
    <br>Kate:  Really?
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  <i>(Shakes her head)</i>  There is something wrong isn't there? </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  We might be able to be of some help.  Tell us. </font>
    <br>Kate: <i>(Nods)</i> Okay.  <i>(Turns away)</i>  It all started this morning.

<p><i>Flashback, Kate comes back home from her errands</i>
    <br>Kate:  When I finished my errands and came home, Lynn was gone.  <i>(She walkes over to the bed and picks up a note)</i> In his letter....it says he is going to persuade the gang to pull themselves out of Donau.  I'm supposed to wait for him at home.

<p><i>Flashback ends</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  He left a letter? </font>
    <br>Kate:  I have an idea!!  <i>(Walks up to Dart)</i>  If I show this letter to the Mayor, he might do something to help!  The Mayor is Lynn's father!
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Nods)</i>  I see.  Let's bring this to the Mayor.  You have to wait for Lynn here.  </font>
    <br>Kate: <i>(Nods, and takes another step towards Dart)</i>  Oh, thank you!
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Nods)</i></font>

<p><i>(In a shop, a bandit and a warrior are harassing the shopkeeper)</i>
    <br>Bandit:  Tut.  That's it!?
    <br>Warrior:  Fine.  We'll let you, but only today!  <i>(Turns to leave)</i>  Let's go!  <i>(Begins to leave and passes Dart, looking at him strangely.)</i>

<p><i>In the Mayor's house, Dart walks up to the Butler</i>

    <br>Butler:  You cannot meet the Mayor because he is busy.  I'm sorry, but please come back some other time.
    <br>Dart:  Can you take a look at this letter?  <i>(Hands the butler the letter from Kate)</i>
    <br>Butler: <i>(Reads the letter)</i>  Th, this is....<i>(Backs off and lets Dart enter)</i>  P, Please come in!!  <i>(Runs over to the Mayor)</i>  Mayor!!  A horrible thing has happened!!  It's about Mr. Lynn!!  <i>(Hands the Mayor the Letter)</i>
    <br>Mayor of Donau: <i>(Reads the letter and turns away)</i> What kind of man would venture to face the Gehrich Gang by himself?
    <br>Butler:  I didn't know Mr. Lynn was consumed with....
    <br>Mayor of Donau:  <i>(Walks away)</i>  It was my fault for not realizing it!!
    <br>Butler:  I bet Miss Kate is very stressed
    <br>Mayor of Donau: <i>(Walks up to Dart and Shana)</i>  You must go.  As the Mayor, I don't want you to be involved in this.
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  We are already involved.  The gang took something very important away from me.  <i>(Walks up to the Mayor)</i>  Where do they come from?  </font>
    <br>Mayor of Donau: <i>(Nods, then looks out the window)</i>  They are from the Valley of Corrupted Gravity, but we don't' know anything about them other than that.
    <br>Butler: <i>(Turns to the Mayor)</i>  That place is very dangerous.  They say nobody can come back once they enter the valley.
    <br>Mayor of Donau: <i>(Turns to the Butler)</i>  Butler!!  Don't say that!!  Lynn...Lynn went there!!
    <br>Butler: <i>(Turns and walks away, then turns back to the Mayor)</i>  Now, we have to gather the people of Donau and form a rescue team.
    <br>Mayor of Donau:  <i>(Turns to the Butler)</i> And then what will happen to the city?  The gang might take over the city.
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Walks up to the Mayor)</i> Let us do it. </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  You were planning to go anyway, weren't you? </font>
    <br>Mayor of Donau: <i>(Turns to Dart and Shana)</i>  Oh...it is encouraging to hear that warriors like you are going!!  <i>(Turns to the butler)</i>  Now, I can face those punks in our city with courage!!

<p><i>Dart leaves.  Outside the Mayor's house, Dart turns to the sound of slapping</i>

    <br><font color="#003399">Girl:  Hey you, alky!  How dare you touch my butt! </font>
    <br>Bandit:  Don't be silly!  Why would I dare to touch the butt of a kid like you?
    <br><font color="#003399">Girl:  What did you say!?  I could forgive you if you'd admit that I'm to sexy to ignore and apologize! </font>
    <br><i>Bandits turn to each other, then the girl)</i>
    <br>Bandit A:  Huh?  Is this kid dreaming or what?
    <br><font color="#003399">Girl:  <i>(Throws hands in the air)</i>  I can't stand it anymore!! </font>
    <br><i>Warrior shrugs.  The girl tramples through him and Bandit A.  Bandit B turns to her and draws his knife, but the girl punches him in the chin. She jumps and throws her fist in the air.  The bandits and the warrior get up)</i>
    <br>Bandit A:  Ouch...!  You!!  You don't' know who we are!?
    <br><font color="#003399">Girl: <i>(Turns to Bandit A)</i> I know. </font>
    <br>Warrior:  <i>(Turns to girl, and girl to him)</i>  You think you can get away with it!?

    <br><i>Bandits all back away and run off</i>
    <br>Bandit B:  <i>(Turns to Girl)</i> Darn!  You'll pay for this!!  <i>(Runs away)</i>
    <br><font color="#003399">Girl:  I won't be paying you!! </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Doesn't she have a better way to say goodbye? </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Girl: <i>(Turns to Dart and the others and draws out her huge hammer)</i>  Are you one of the Gehrich Gang?  Do you want me to smash you too!? </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Walks away)</i>  'Cuz I heard it from Kate.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Shrugs)</i>  It's somewhere in the Valley of Corrupted Gravity, isn't it? </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  Wow, how na�ve!!  <i>(Spins around and jumps in front of Dart)</i>  You make it sound easy,  but you cannot go through such a mell of a hess kind of place without a person like me whose totally knowledgeable and totally pretty!  <i>(Spins around and leans forward)</i>  Besides, you need the Permission of the King just to enter the valley!  Don't ya know that!? </font>
    <br><i>Dart shakes his head</i>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  <i>(Turns to Dart)</i>  What are we going to do Dart?  This girl is serious. </font>
    <br><i>Dart folds his arms</i>

<p><i>In bar, Kaffi is seen chatting with Martel</i>

    <br>Martel:  How many times do I have to say it?  I wanna hear about Stardust not just stars.
    <br>Kaffi:  I told you that if I don't know about it, nobody knows about it.  SO, don't you wanna talk about something else?

    <br>Martel:  What was all that about?  <i>(Shrugs and turn to Dart)</i>  You must be the folks who bumped into me in Bale aren't you.  <i>(Scratches head)</i>  Sorry about that.
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Shakes his head)</i>  It's okay.  By the way, what were you talking about?  Stardust? </font>
    <br>Martel:  <i>(Folds arms)</i>  Hmm....<i>(unfolds arms)</i>  You look like you've traveled all over the world, I might as well just ask you about it!  <i>(Turns and walks away)</i>  Stardust is a miracle stone and if you collect them all, your wish comes true.  <i>(Turns back to Dart)</i>  And I have a favor to ask you, why don't you give me the Stardust if you find some?  <i>(Walks up to Dart)</i>  Of course I didn't say for free.  I'll give ya something rare that I found on my journey in return.  Whaddaya think?  Not bad huh?  <i>(Dart crosses his arms)</i>  You don't have to but if you happen to find some on your journey, remember me, will ya?  <i>(Walks over to the table)</i>  I decided to stay in this town for a while

    <br>Giant Gate Keeper:  <i>(Shakes head)</i>  I, I didn't do anything.  You bumped into me by yourself.  You can't enter the castle by doing that.

<p><i>Dart walks up to Nello and taps his shoulder</i>
    <br>Nello:  What!?  You want to go to the Valley of Corrupted Gravity!?  I recommend you change your mind!  <i>(Shakes head)</i> Lately they say, the Barrens are infested by bandits called the Gehrichs.  Of course when the earth is filled with green, I think those gangs will change their attitude.  <i>(Goes back to work)</i>

<p><i>Dart walks up to Kaffi and taps her shoulder</i>
    <br>Kaffi:  Hey!!  You're back!  What would you like?  <i>(Dart tells her)</i>  What?  The Valley of Corrupted Gravity!?  We don't have such a cocktail!  <i>(Dart shakes his head and tells her again)</i>  Why are you thinking that you wanna go there!  I dunno what you have in mind but just chug-a-lug up and fawgetaboutit!

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Shakes his head</i>  No, I am not. </font>
    <br>Fester:  Oh, you look troubled.  I would like to say I can help you, but I am a little busy now.  <i>(Walks over to another case of items)</i>  It will be over soon.  I need some materials on stars for my research.  I have to look in a couple of more places.  <i>(Goes to leave, then turns to Dart)</i>  I have to go now.  When I finish my errand, I'll be available.  Ask me whatever you want.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Shakes head)</i>  Not yet.  I guess, you are the only person we can ask, Fester. </font>
    <br>Fester: <i>(Nods)</i>  I see.  Fine.  I have finished my errand.  You can come to my house and talk.
    <br><i>Dart nods and follows Fester to his house, where they talk for awhile</i>
    <br>Fester:  <i>(Brings hand to chin)</i> Gehrich Gang, I see.  They must have taken one of your most important possessions, if you are thinking of venturing directly into their hideout.
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Nods)</i> It's not just a memento.  It means more than that to me. </font>

    <br><i>Dart nods</i>
    <br>Fester:  <i>(Turns to Shana and nods)</i>  I understand.  Shall we go to the castle?  <i>(Nods)</i> I can take care of it.  I have a side business in addition to being an astronomer that lets me freely enter the castle.

    <br>Fester: <i>(Nods)</i> Yes, I am.  You can enter the castle by mentioning my name.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Scratches his head)</i>  You, you think so? </font>
    <br><i>(Albert folds his arms)</i>


<p><i>Bell rings</i>
    <br>Fester: <i>(Turns to the others)</i>  It's time to go.  Let's head to the Twin Castle.  Follow me.

<p><i>At gate, the Giant Gate Keeper moves aside and allows Fester and Dart to enter</i>

<p><i>In castle, Fester leads Dart to the Sun Chamber.  Fester, Albert, and Dart approach and kneel to the King</i>

    <br>Fester:  I am here, Your Majesty.
    <br>King Zior:  <i>(Gets up from his throne)</i>  Oh, Fester!  Please take care of my dear Princess Lisa, for today!  <i>(Puts hand to chin)</i> By the way, I think I have some problem with my eyes.  I see many Festers.
    <br>Fester:  <i>(Gets up and walks up to the King)</i>  King Zior...There is only one of me.  These people are my friends, Your Majesty.
    <br>King Zior:  <i>(Puts hand to chin, then nods)</i>  Oh indeed there is only one Fester!  And, what is their request?
    <br><i>Albert and Dart stand up, and Albert walks up to the King</i>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  We are there to request permission to enter the Valley of Corrupted Gravity. </font>
    <br>King Zior:  <i>(Puts hand to chin)</i> Hmm...Fester...I think I've heard of the "Valley of Corrupted Gravity"...Was it my imagination?
    <br>Fester: <i>(Shakes his head)</i>  King Zior...Your ears are fine too.  These people need to talk to the Gehrich Gang so they would like to go to the Valley of Corrupted Gravity.
    <br>King Zior: <i>(Throws arms out)</i>  Oh, you too!  <i>(Turns to his left and walks a little bit)</i>  Well, the other day, a young man named Lynn came to me for the same reason.  <i>(Turns back to Fester)</i>  It seems being a daredevil is becoming trendy nowadays.
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Shakes his head)</i>  We are not going there for a picnic.  </font>
    <br>King Zior:  <i>(Sits back down in his thrown)</i> You understand all the risks.  Fine.  Servant!  Bring the pass for them!
    <br><i>Guard walks up to Dart and gives the Pass for the Valley of Corrupted Gravity</i>
    <br>King Zior:  Be careful!
    <br>Dart: <i>(Nods)</i>  I appreciate this Your Majesty.
    <br>King Zior:  <i>(Stands up)</i>  It is late already.  Why don't you relax in the castle.
    <br><i>(Dart nods and kneels)</i>

<p><i>Outside the Sun Chamber, Fester turns to Dart</i>
    <br>Fester:  I am going back to work.  Princess Lisa's studies are going very well by herself.
    <br><i>Dart nods and Fester leaves</i>

<p><i>As Dart leaves, he hears a voice and turns to it</i>
    <br>Lady's maid Libria:  Excuse me, Your Majesty Albert. <i>(She goes up to Albert and bows)</i>  I am Libria, the Lady's maid for Princess Lisa.  Pirncess Lisa had me call you and your company.
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: <i>(Nods, then walks up to her)</i> ...Princess Lisa knew of our visit. </font>
    <br>Lady's maid Libria: <i>(Stands up straight and nods)</i>  She speaks with the stars and knows the future.  Astrology shows her the way.  <i>(She walks away a little, then turns back to Albert)</i>  This way please. <i>(She leaves)</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Turns to Albert and taps his shoulder)</i> What is going on? </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: <i>(Begins to follow Libria)</i>  We will find out when we meet Princess Lisa. </font>

<p><i>Albert leaves, Dart following.  They all get to a balcony overlooking the sea where Princess Lisa awaits</i>
    <br>Lisa:  <i>(Turns to Albert and curtseys)</i> Welcome, Albert, the King of Serdio.  I am Lisa, the younger sister of Emille.  I have invited you here because I have a favor to ask of you.
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: <i>(Folds arms, then runs over to Dart, who turns to her)</i>  Hey wait a minute!  How does she know he's a king? </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Albert was talking about it a moment ago, wasn't he?  Princess Lisa found out about it through astrology. </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: <i>(Runs up to Dart)</i>  Hold there!  <i>(Shrugs)</i>  What the heck is astrology? </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  <i>(Haschel turns to her)</i>  It is the telling of a person's fortune from the location of the stars. </font>
    <br>Lisa:  <i>(Nods, and Meru and Haschel turn to her)</i>  *Giggle*....You have such amusing friends.
    <br><i>Haschel scratches his head and Meru puts her hand to her chin, and then they both back off</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Please continue. </font>
    <br>Lisa:  <i>(Turns to Dart and nods)</i>  It is about my sister Emille.
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  <i>(Shakes his head, and Lisa turns to him)</i>  What has happened to the princess?  I cannot believe that's her normal self....</font>
    <br>Lisa: <i>(Nods)</i>  Well, it started a half year ago.  <i>(Walks up a bit, then turns to the sea)</i> Back then, my sister Emille was very kind, and my...or everyone in the country admired her.  <i>(Turns to the others)</i>  It all started when the two of us when horseback riding.  Suddenly, my sister Emille's horse bucked and ran away to the forest.
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  <i>(Brings her hands to her mouth)</i>  What about Princess Emille? </font>
    <br>Lisa:  <i>(Shakes her head)</i>  It seemed that my sister lost consciousness, and couldn't control the horse.  I chased her with my vassals.  <i>(Turns away from them and takes a step forward)</i>  My sister was on the ground in the forest.  Fortunately, she didn't have any injuries.  Everybody felt profound relief.    <i>(Shakes head, then turns back to the others)</i>  However, when my sister Emille came to, she was a completely different person.  Everyone says it is because she hit herself on her head, however, something more than her language and attitude was wrong.  It was as if she was a different person...
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: <i>(Shakes his head)</i>  Does anybody doubt the change?  How about King Zior? </font>
    <br>Lisa:  <i>(Shakes her head, then turns away)</i>  No, instead he was happy to see my sister Emille become so active...<i>(Turns back to them and nods)</i>  I heard you are heading to the Valley of Corrupted Gravity.  And I have a favor to ask.  I would like you to find out about the relationship between my sister Emille and the Gehrich Gang.
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Shrugs, and Lisa turns to him)</i>  The relationship between Princess Emille and the Gehrich? </font>
    <br>Lisa: <i>(Nods)</i>  Tiberoa appears to be peaceful, however, we are having a serious problem.  It is infested with bandits.
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Shrugs, and Lisa turns to her)</i>  Donau is totally awful now! </font>
    <br>Lisa: <i>(Nods)</i>  I know.  However, it used to be different.  Yes, until a half year ago.
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: <i>(Shrugs)</i>  It was the same time Princess Emille began acting strange. </font>
    <br>Lisa:  <i>(Nods)</i>  Astrology also says there is some kind of relatinship between my sister and the Gehrichs.  And one more thing...<i>(Nods)</i>  The stars told me "Never hand over the Moon".  <i>(Walks up to them)</i>  My sister will celebrate her 20th birthday soon.  At the ceremony, the Tiberoan national treasure, the Moon Dagger will be passed down to my sister Emille.  I assume the "Moon" refers to that.
    <br><i>(Dart and Albert turn to each other and nod)</i>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  The second divine moon object. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  It is linked with Lloyd. </font>
    <br><i>(Albert nods.  He and Dart turn to Lisa)</i>
    <br>Lisa:  I have to find out the truth before the ceremony.  About the relationship between my sister Emille and the Gehrich Gang.  Would you please look into that for me?

<p><i>Answer to "..."</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Lowers his head)</i> ...</font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: <i>(Turns to Dart)</i>  What are you hesitating about? </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  <i>(Shrugs and Dart turns to her)</i>  You are thinking about Lloyd aren't you? </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Nods)</i>  I know there is no reason to say no.  But I'm worried if I can fight with him without having a Dragoon Spirit...?</font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Shakes head)</i>  You...since when have you become such a wimp?  Or...maybe you've grown too accustomed to using the power? </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Lowers his head and shakes it, then turns to Lisa)</i>  I understand...Princess Lisa.  </font>
    <br>Lisa: <i>(Nods)</i>  Thank you.  I appreciate it.

<p><i>Answer to "We will"</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Nods)</i> We will.  We have no reason not to because our original intention was to pursue the Gehrich Gang. </font>
    <br>Lisa: <i>(Nods)</i>  Thank you.  I appreciate it.

<p>Voice:  <i>(Lisa turns to the voice)</i>  The dinner will be ready soon your highness.
    <br>Lisa:  <i>(Turns to the others)</i>  Oh, it is already that late?  Oh, I forgot about Fester!  I left him in my room!  <i>(Turns to leave, then turns back to the others)</i> I am expecting you there.  <i>(Leaves, and Libria enters)</i>
    <br>Lady's maid Libria:  King Zior also said to invite everyone.  When you are ready please let me know.  I will take you to the dining room. <i>(Leaves)</i>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Walks to the exit, and spins and jumps)</i>  I was totally right about coming with you Dart!!  I was expecting these things to happen!! </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Walks up to Meru and throws out his arms)</i>  Right!?  I am looking forward to it!  I wonder what I can feast on there!  </font>
    <br><i>Meru and Haschel begin jumping excitedly, everyone else just shrugs</i>

<p><i>Asking Libria</i>
    <br>Lady's maid Libria:  Oh, everyone.  Are you ready for dinner?

<p><i>Answer to "Please wait a little"</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Please wait a little. </font>
    <br>Lady's maid Libria:  I see.  But please hurry up.  Everyone is waiting for you.
    <br><i>Dart nods</i>

<p><i>Answer to "Yes, we are ready"</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Nods)</i> Yes, we are ready.</font>
    <br>Lady's maid Libria:  Now, I will show you the way to the dining room.

<p><i>At dinner, Emille is eating very sloppily</i>
    <br>King Zior:  <i>(Turns to Dart)</i>  Please make yourself at home!  <i>(Throws his arms out)</i> Haa Haa Haa!  Isn't she a great eater!  It seems when girls become 20 years old they develop quite an appetite!  <i>(Turns to Fester)</i>  Oh, Fester?  Would you introduce our guests to Emille?
    <br>Fester:  Yes, Your Majesty.
    <br>Emille: <i>(Stops eating an turns to Fester)</i>  Oh, I didn't know you were here, Fester.  Are you still wasting time on useless things?  Those things with moons or stars?  <i>(Goes back to eating)</i>
    <br>Fester: L, let me introduce my friends, Your Highness!  This...
    <br>Emille: <i>(Stops eating, then points her knife to Albert and Dart)</i>  You and you.  What's your name?
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  I'm Dart. </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  I am Albert.  It is a pleasure to meet you. </font>
    <br>Emille:  <i>(Goes back to eating)</i>  You are cute guys.  I like you.
    <br>Fester:  I'm glad to hear that.  And these....
    <br>Emille:  <i>(Throws her hands in the air)</i>  I didn't ask you about the others
    <br>King Zior:  <i>(Shakes head and turns to the others)</i>  Oh, please don't be insulted.  Emille is a bit shy.
    <br>Emille:  <i>(Stops eating)</i>  I'm not shy!  I don't like them.  That's all!  <i>(Turns to the side)</i>  Hey!!  Bring more food will ya!! <i>(Returns to eating)</i>
    <br>Lisa:  Please enjoy your meal.  I assume you are leaving early tomorrow morning?
    <br>Emille:  <i>(Stops eating)</i>  Where are you going?
    <br>King Zior:  <i>(Nods and turns to her)</i>  Well, they are saying that hey want to go to the Valley of Corrupted Gravity.  They understand the risk so I have granted them permission.
    <br>Emille:  <i>(Drops her knife and stars and the King a moment.  She then picks up her knife from the floor and goes back to eating)</i>  Huh!  Stupid guys!
    <br>King Zior:  <i>(Nods and turns to the others)</i>  Come on!  Enjoy yourself!  Let yourself go tonight!

<p><i>After dinner, the group meets on the balcony</i>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  Can people change that much from only the shock of falling from a horse? </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: <i>(Shrugs)</i>  I can produce the same impact with my fist. </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: <i>(Shrugs)</i>  It won't work! </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: <i>(Jumps off the railing she was sitting on)</i> Then with my hammer! </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  It won't work either.</font>
    <br><i>Lisa enters, and everyone turns to her</i>
    <br>Lisa:  Everyone, it is getting late.  Please stay at the castle tonight.
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  <i>(Walks up to Lisa)</i>  Thank you for your concern. </font>
    <br>Lisa: <i>(Shakes her head)</i>  It is fine.  It is me asking you the favor.  Have a good night.
    <br><i>Leaves, then Libria enters</i>
    <br>Lady's maid Libria:  This way please.  I will show you the way to your bedroom.  <br><i>Leaves with the others following</i>

<p><i>In the guest room</i>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  *Sigh* <i>(Sits on bed and turns to Dart)</i> You don't like such a formal feast, do you Dart?  Aren't you tired? </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Shrugs)</i> I would rather practice with my sword. </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Shrugs)</i> I didn't have enough to eat!  Princess Emille stole my portion! </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  Me either.  And I was looking forward to it.</font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: <i>(Nods)</i> I understand Princess Lisa's hardship.  <i>(Everyone except Rose nods)</i> But, Princess Emille might lead us to Lloyd.  The Moon Dagger is our Guide. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Sits down on the bed across from Shana and shrugs)</i> Everything leads to the Gehrich. </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: <i>(Nods)</i> It all started with the Dragoon Spirit. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Shrugs</i>  We have to get it back quick or it'll be too risky. </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  <i>(Gets up and turns to Dart, who also gets up and turns to her, and Haschel and Albert turn to her as well)</i>  You shouldn't have let it be taken to start with, then. </font>
    <br><i>Dart puts his hands to his head</i>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Shakes his head)</i>  You are harsh as always.  There are some other ways to say that.  Why don't you show a little smile at least? </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  <i>(Shakes her head)</i>  I don't remember...how to smile.  <i>(Turns away)</i> Good night.  <i>(Leaves)</i></font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  <i>(Lies down on the bed and Albert turns to her)</i>  I'm getting sleepy too. </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  <i>(Shrugs)</i>  I'll get some sleep too.  <i>(Leaves)</i></font>
    <br><i>Everyone settles down except Meru, Haschel, and Dart</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Walks up to Shana and nods)</i> Good night, Shana. <i>(Dart walks up to Meru)</i>  Won't you sleep? </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Shrugs)</i> I'll be in danger if I go to sleep before Dart. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Shrugs)</i> What are you talking about?</font>
    <br><i>Meru ignores him</i></font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Dart walks up to Haschel, who is sitting on the edge of a bed)</i> Thinking about something? </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Gets up and shrugs)</i> Being with you young people reminds me of Claire. </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:   <i>(Walks up to them, and they turn to her)</i> What's she like? </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Shrugs)</i> She had a strong will.  She suffered by herself, decided things by herself. </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: <i>(Nods, and throws her fist in the air)</i> Same here! </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: <i>(Puts his hand to his chin and shrugs)</i> Call me a fond parent, but she looked like her beautiful mother.  She was a strong fighter, but her heart was too sweet.  <i>(Shrugs)</i> It's the complete opposite of Meru. </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Shakes her head and shrugs)</i> I am a strong fighter too! </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Shrugs, and Meru turns to him)</i> That's not the point. </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Shakes his head and shrugs)</i> I only taught her how to use her fists, but I wish I could see her in a wedding dress. </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Backs off a little and throws her fist in the air)</i> You can see me in a wedding dress!!  <i>(Shrugs)</i> I'll be totally beautiful in that!  Don't you think? </font>

<p><i>Answer to "I don't know."</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Shakes his head)</i> I don't know. </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Nods and shrugs)</i> I don't know either.  Meru does not have a mature charm. </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Throws out her fists)</i> Hey hey!  <i>(Jumps on the bed)</i> Boring!  I'm gonna go to bed!! </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Shrugs)</i>  I'll get some sleep too.  <i>(Stretches and leaves)</i></font>

<p><i>Answer to "Yes, I think so."</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Nods)</i>  Yes, I think so. </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: <i>(Spins)</i> Right!?  <i>(Jumps on the bed)</i>  Happy sleeping time! </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Shrugs)</i>  I'll get some sleep too.  <i>(Stretches and leaves)</i></font>
    <br><i>Dart and Haschel settle down and sleep</i>

<p><i>Dart approaches guard at the Gate to the Valley of Corrupted Gravity</i>

    <br>Tiberoan Guard:  It is blockaded by the ordinance of King Zior!  I cannot let anybody not having a pass issued by the Court pass through. <i>(Dart shows him the pass)</i>  !!  Oh, excuse me sir!  This is a pass for the Valley of Corrupted Gravity!!  <i>(Turns to the guard above)</i>  The gate!  Open the gate!!  <i>(The earth shakes as the gate opens, the Guard turns back to Dart)</i>  Over there is the territory of the Gehrich Gang!  If that's not enough the gravity is warped!  Advance with caution sirs!

<p><i>In the Valley</i>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: <i>(Runs ahead and kicks a rock off a ledge)</i>  Oh!  It's not bad at all!  I was expecting to have some fun!  <i>(Turns back to Dart)</i></font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: !! Meru!  Watch out!! </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Turns around and falls to her butt as a huge rock comes flying at her from the same direction she kicked the smaller rock)</i> Oh god!! </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  It still has the backwash from the Dragon Campaign.  <i>(Dart and Shana turn to her)</i>  The collision of magic power of the Dragoons and Winglies can distort nature quite a bit. <i>(She picks up a rock and gently tosses it over the ledge and watches it float away.  She turns to Meru)</i>  I don't think you're gonna have much "fun" from now on. </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  I'm not just following you guys for that!  <i>(Dart and Shana turn to her)</i>  Let's go guys!  We gotta find the Gehrichs! </font>

<p><i>Later, Dart notices something ahead</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: !! </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  What a welcome we got. </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  Oh, look! </font>
    <br><i>They see the stone Virage</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Virage!! </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  Huh?  What the heck is that? </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  What is worse is it has the complete form....</font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Turns to the others)</i>  Guys!  I'm asking you what is that! </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Turns to Meru)</i>  It might be the real cause of the distortion of the valley. </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  Wow!  That's scary! </font>
    <br><i>Shana falls to her knees and everyone turns to her</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Shana? </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  Here it comes again.  I hear the voice, again.  <i>(Turns to Dart)</i> Don't go!  <i>(Stands up)</i>  It's to dangerous to go! </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: <i>(Turns to Dart)</i>  Yes, we gotta go.  We're not gonna make it to the Gehrichs without going over this thinamajig.  <i>(Dart turns to her)</i>  What are you looking at!?  You guys don't trust me!? </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Is there no way to but advance? </font>

<p><i>Later, as they approach the stone Virage</i>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  <i>(Falls to her knees)</i>  I can't let you go!  If we advance we will have to fight again!</font>
    <br><i>(Dart walks over to her)</i>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Hey, nothing can be done without meeting the Gehrichs, right?  What about Lynn, Dart's memento, and this Lloyd that you are looking for. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Worrying won't help.  Besides, it might not start to move this time. </font>
    <br><i>The Virage starts to move</i>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: <i>(Stands up)</i>  Everyone run!! </font>
    <br><i>Dart draws his sword</i>

<p><i>Battle begins</i>

<p><i>After battle</i>

<p><i>Virage screams and backs off the cliff.  It reaches for Shana.  Dart and Rose run to her</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Shana!! </font>
    <br><i>Both Dart and Rose stop and gasp as Shana's forehead begins to glow blue.  The light pushes the Virage off the cliff</i>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  <i>(Walks up to Shana)</i>  Shana!  What on earth are you...to Virage? </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  <i>(Puts her hands to her face)</i>  I don't know...I don't know anything!! </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Walks up to Shana and puts his hands on her shoulder)</i>  There is no more Virage!! </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  <i>(Looks up at Dart)</i>  Da - rt.  <i>(Shakes her head)</i> It's okay now. </font>
    <br><i>(Dart nods)</i>

<p><i>Later, everyone is sitting and taking a break, slightly spread out in a ravine</i>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: (The power that can awake the sleep of 11,000 years....Is that rancor against us?  the rancor against Dragoons awakening the Virage!?  Or...is that something to do with Shana?) </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: (Shana....)</font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  Thanks to my guiding you, it was totally thrilling, wasn't it!?  <i>(Stands up)</i> Now we can go straight to the Gehrich Gang!  We can go rescue Lynn! </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  After you came back, Dart, a lot of things started to happen.  But we have overcome everything, and we will continue.  <i>(Stands up and turns to him)</i> Because I am not alone now.  Everybody is with me and, I have you...Dart.  You make me strong.  <i>(Throws arms in air)</i> I can do it!  I can leave any time! </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  There must be something wrong with Shana, and she must definitely see it.  <i>(Turns to Dart)</i>  Everybody knows that. </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Stands up and looks over at Shana)</i>  Shana has changed.  She has obtained more strength. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  I agree. </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  I don't know what is happening to Shana, but she is trying to solve that alone.  She has become a woman. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  I guess so. </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Turns to Dart)</i>  It's not the time to talk about this but....It's time for you to change. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Me? </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  It's too hard on Shana, if you continue to treat her like a mere baby sister forever.  <i>(Turns to Shana)</i>  Doesn't matter.  Your Dragoon Spirit is waiting.  We have to think about going. </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  <i>(Stands up and turns to Shana)</i> we were saved by Shana. <i>(Dart turns away.  Albert brings his hand to his chin)</i>  But it seems that this is not that simple for her.  <i>(Dart turns to Albert, and he to him)</i>  The existence of Dragoons and the existence of Virages should have ended 11,000 years ago.  <i>(Shrugs)</i> But they were brought to life around us.  <i>(Shrugs again)</i>  I think we have to go forward to find out more about it.  <i>(They both look away a moment)</i></font>

    <br><i>Dart stands in the center of everyone</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Let's go everybody!  The Gehrichs will be just ahead! </font>
    <br><i>(They all gather and leave)</i>

<p><i>In the Home of the Giganto</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Walks up the staircase)</i>  I sense the enemy's presence.  <i>(Draws sword and approaches gate.  Arrows rain down and laughter is heard)</i></font>
    <br>Gehrich Gang B:  I don't know what you want, and how did you manage to get all the way here!?
    <br>Gehrich Gang D:  We should play with them a little!!
    <br>Gehrich Gang C:  Yo men!!  Don't kill'em!!  That's what our boss said!!  But....
    <br>Gehrich Gang A:  Why don't we stomp them till they hate being alive!!  Haa Haa Haa!!
    <br>Gang:  Shoot 'em!!
    <br><i>(Arrows rain down.  Dart tries to go through the gate but it closes and the gang laughs)</i>
    <br>Gehrich Gang A:  You thought it would be that easy, huh!?  <i>(They continue shooting arrows)</i>
    <br><i>(Dart tries the other exit, but is stopped by a Gangster and a Bandit</i>
    <br>Gangster B:  Hee Hee Hee!!  Where are you goin!?
    <br><i>They continue shooting arrows.  After several moments, the gang gives up</i>
    <br>Gehrich Gang A:  Darn!!  Those nimble rats!!
    <br>Gehrich Gang B:  Yo, brother!!  Take care of them will ya!!  <i>(The Gang begins cheering as Gangster A approaches)</i>
    <br>Gangster A:  Yeah!  I got'em!!  <i>(Jumps down and two more bandits join him)</i> It's been a while.  I'm aching to get'em!!
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Puts his sword away)</i> Let us meet with your boss!!  We have to talk!! </font>
    <br>Gangster A:  There will be no "talking"!  You've already ruined our territory!  <i>(Begins to show off his moves and Dart draws his weapon again)</i>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  That pose, it must be from the Rouge School!  <i>(Dart turns to him)</i></font>
    <br>Gangster A:  <i>(Stops posing)</i> What!?  How do you know about that!?
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Shrugs)</i> That's my question!  How did you find out about the Rouge School!? </font>
    <br>Gangster A:  Humph!!  Who cares!!  If you really wanna learn about it, tussle with me!

<p><i>Bandits jump and fight begins</i>

<p><i>After battle</i>

    <br>Bandits: R, Run!!  <i>(Several begin running.  Dart and Haschel threaten the others)</i> Yeek!!  <i>(They run off)</i>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Turns to Gangster A)</i>  The Rouge School of Martial Arts is a tradition found only in my village.  All of the people who use the Rouge style from outside of my village must have a connection there.  <i>(Takes a step forward, and the Gangster backs off)</i> Do you know a woman fighter named Claire?  <i>(Takes another step forward, and the Gangster backs off again)</i></font>
    <br>Gangster :  I, I don't know any such woman!  I learned it form my boss, Gehrich!
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  Gehrich....</font>
    <br>Gangster:  My boss used to study it seriously, but he was kicked out 20 years ago.  Then he became a bandit!
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Throws arms in the air)</i>  Kicked out....<i>(Takes another step forward, the Gangster backs off)</i>  Now I know!!  That Gehrich!!  He must be the man who once was my disciple!! <i>(Takes another step forward, the Gangster backs off)</i></font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  He is over there, right? </font>
    <br><i>Both Haschel and Gangster turn to Dart</i>
    <br>Gangster:  Y, yeah!  But!  You cannot defeat my boss!  My boss is ten times as strong as me!!
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Turns to the Gangster, and he to him, and then poses)</i> It's my fist that decides if I can defeat him or not!!</font>
    <br><i>Gangster backs off and then runs away</i>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: <i>(Turns to the gate)</i> We're on our way.  </font><i>(Walks up to gate while stretching his arm)</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  What are you doing? </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Turns to Dart)</i>  I'll show you what the real Rouge School is like.  <i>(Turns to gate and begins to focus his energy)</i>  YAAAAAAAA!!  <i>(Punches gate)</i>  YAAA!!!  <i>(Gate crumbles into the ground.  Haschel turns to Dart)</i>  Shall we? </font>

<p><i>They leave.  Later, near the entrace to a cave</i>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  It seems obvious there are bandits hiding. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Let's start looking here. </font>
    <br><i>Rose and Albert enter the cave.  Haschel falls to his knees.  Shana turns to him</i>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  What's wrong? </font>
    <br><i>Dart and Meru turn to Haschel</i>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  I think I did too much.  My back hurts.  <i>(Pauses a moment, then stands up)</i> Don't worry.  I'll be all right if I rest a little.  <i>(Sits down on a nearby rock)</i></font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Turns away)</i> Men!  You should've thought about your age!   <i>(Turns to Dart)</i>  Go ahead, I'll take care of him. </font>
    <br><i>Dart, Shana, and Haschel all turn to her</i>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  Hm.  You will?  I think I can wait here by myself....</font>
    <br><i>Meru, Dart, and Shana all turn to him</i>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  No way!  We don't know when they will come back! </font>
    <br><i>(Dart and Shana turn to each other)</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  We gotta leave them, then. </font>
    <br><i>Meru turns to Dart.  Dart and Shana turn to Haschel</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  We'll be back if something happens. </font>
    <br><i>Shana and Dart enter the cave.  Meru walks up to the cave</i>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  If they come back, I'll destroy them!  <i>(Turns to Haschel)</i>  Be good, Haschel.  <i>(She keeps a lookout in front of the cave)</i></font>
    <br></i>Haschel stands up, sneaks behind her, and knocks her out with his hand</i>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  Ah....</font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  Sorry about that.  <i>(Runs up the stairs)</i></font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  I guess there are only Rock Fireflies here.  <i>(Exits the cave)</i> Meru!! <i>(Runs over to her as the others exit the cave)</i> What happened!? <i>(Helps Meru up)</i></font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  Ouch...Um...Something bumped into me and...<i>(Turns to Dart)</i>  Oh boy?  Where is Haschel? </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Did he go by himself!? </font>
    <br><i>They all go up the stairs</i>
    <br><i>Kongol appears</i>

<p><i>Meanwhile, in the chamber, Gehrich is sitting on a giant thrown and Mappi is at his side.  A bandit runs up to them, tells them of the others, and leaves</i>
    <br>Mappi:  <i>(Laughs)</i> Hee hee hee!!  I cannot stop laughing!  Boss!  They came all the way here!  I guess that pebble I took was super important.
    <br>Gehrich:  There are too many people who don't care about their lives.  The snotnose from Donau too.
    <br>Mappi:  <i>(Walks to the other side of the throne)</i>  Let's just kill that kid!  I don't care that he's the son of the Mayor!  I got that woman with us now!  <i>(Walks back to the other side)</i> Now is a good chance, cuz the woman is in control of the palace....It'll be a piece of cake to take over this country....
    <br>Gehrich:  My fist doesn't desire that kind of thing.  I just want to live free.  If she wants the power, I'll give it to her.
    <br>Mappi:  <i>(Walks over to the other side)</i>  Boss!!  You're gonna be taken advantage of, being a wimp like that!!
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  Gehrich, you haven't changed a bit. </font>
    <br><i>Both Mappi and Gehrich turn to see Haschel enter.  Gehrich gets up from his throne</i>
    <br>Mappi:  Who are you!?
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  Shut up, you small fry. </font>
    <br>Mappi:  What did you say!?  <i>(Turns to Gehrich)</i>  Boss?  Is something wrong?
    <br>Gehrich:  M, Master....
    <br>Mappi:  <i>(Walks to the other side)</i>  Master of the Rouge School?
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Throws arms in the air)</i>  Head of the bandits?  How low you have fallen.  I was right to kick you out. </font>
    <br>Gehrich:  <i>(Throws fist in air)</i>  Yes!!  You were right!!  Thanks to you I obtained freedom!! I am not the person you remember!!
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Takes a step forward)</i>  Martial arts is your heart.  When you hit, your fist aches, and your heart aches.  Except, it seems your heart has forgotten the ache. </font>
    <br>Gehrich: ....
    <br>Mappi: <i>(Turns to Haschel)</i>  Shut up!!  I'll shut you up!!  <i>(Goes to attack Haschel, who prepares to fight, but Dart appears and blocks it, sending Mappi back to the throne)</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Turns to Haschel)</i>  Have I kept you waiting!? </font>
    <br><i>Haschel turns to Dart, then to the others as they appear</i>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  It's not fair leaving me like that!! </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Relaxes)</i>  You....<i>(Turns to Gehrich)</i></font>
    <br>Gehrich:  <i>(Walks down the stairs of the throne)</i>  Then why don't you remind me of your so-called aching heart!!  <i>(Poses, and Mappi leaps in the air)</i>

<p><i>Battle begins</i>

<p><i>After battle</i>
    <br><i>Haschel punches Gehrich into a statue</i>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  Take that!! </font>
    <br>Mappi:  <i>(Tries to get up)</i>  I'll smash you!!  <i>(Falls to the ground)</i>
    <br><i>The entire chamber begins to shake as part of a statue crumbles</i>
    <br>Gehrich:  <i>(Looks up in fear as the statue begins falling.  He turns to Haschel)</i> Please run!!  Master!!
    <br><i>Haschel turns to Gehrich, then looks up and gasps as the statue comes tumbling down.  Meru hides behind Shana and Albert ducks</i>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: It's hopeless!!  <i>(Covers his head)</i></font>
    <br><i>The statue is about to crush them all when it is suddenly stopped.  Albert uncovers his head and turns to see Kongol, who has caught the statue.  Kongol chucks the statue out of the way</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Takes a step back)</i> Kongol!? </font>
    <br><i>Kongol turns to Dart</i>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Kneels by Gehrich)</i> Gehrich....Now I seem to be helping you remember the ache in your heart with my fist. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Will he make it? </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Turns to Dart)</i> Barely, at least for now.  But if the Giganto over there hadn't saved us, he would be completely dead by now...and all of us too. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Turns to Kongol)</i> Kongol, why are you here?  And, why did you save us? </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  It's a strange way to get revenge on us.  What's goin on in your mind? </font>
    <br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol:  <i>(Shrugs slightly)</i> You enemy no more.  Here Holy place of Gigantos.  Me survivor. </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  <i>(Takes a step towards him)</i> What about the other Gigantos? </font>
    <br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol:  <i>(Turns to her)</i> Humans killed us.  They stole Giganto's treasure. <i>(Takes a step towards her)</i> Human think s other species can die.  Human selfish creature. </font>
    <br><i>Shana covers her mouth and backs off</i>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  That was the reason why joined the human's war? </font>
    <br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol:  <i>(Turns to Albert)</i> It's for Emperor Doel.  Me still small and ran.  He saved Kongol.  He fought against bad people.  <i>(Turns to Dart)</i> Kongol comes with you.  So Kongol is here.  <i>(Meru and Shana turn to each other)</i> Emperor Doel say he make world where every species equal.  World needs strong leader.  <i>(Walks up to Dart)</i> Whether you can be leader, Kongol will watch to the end.  Giganto's sadness should not be repeated....</font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  There is no such world were "equal" exists.  What we have is killing and being killed.  That's it.  </font>
    <br><i>Kongol crosses his arms and turns to her</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Runs over to Rose)</i> Wait!  <i>(Turns to Kongol)</i>  I have my own objectives.  I am just continuing my journey towards them.  I don't think I make a good "leader". </font>
    <br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol:  <i>(Unfolds arms and turns to Dart)</i>  You defeat Emperor Doel.  Strong Strong Power.  Stronger than Emperor Doel.  Kongol wants to see where the power goes. </font>
    <br><i>(Rose shrugs, turns away and walks off.  Meru and Shana turn to Kongol)</i>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  Sounds good doesn't it?  Cuz more people makes us feel more secure.  Besides....<i>(Shana and Meru turn to each other)</i>  I understand how he feels to be attracted to you, Dart.  There must be something wherever you go.  I still dunno what it s but...I wanna be with you and do something.  Don't you guys feel that way? </font> <i>(They turn back to Dart)</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  ...Okay.  <i>(Turns to Rose, then back to Kongol)</i>  We are friends now. </font>
    <br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol:  <i>(Crosses arms)</i>  ...Friend.  <i>(Pauses)</i> It sounds good.  <i>(Unfolds arms)</i></font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Throws fist in air)</i>  We did it! </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  <i>(Turns to the others)</i>  You have forgotten the most important thing. </font><i>(Dart turns to her)</i>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Throws fist in air again)</i>  Come on!  We gotta find Lynn! </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  The Dragoon Spirit too! </font>
    <br><i>(Dart turns to them)</i>
    <br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol:  What you are looking for may be down there.  You push the thing up there. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Dart turns to Kongol, and then walks up to the throne)</i> Is this it? <i>(Pulls lever, and the throne sinks into the ground and becomes a staircase)</i></font>
    <br>Gehrich:  Ugh...!!
    <br><br><i>Dart turns to Gehrich</i>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  Gehrich, you have come around. </font>
    <br><i>Everyone turns to Gehrich</i>
    <br>Gehrich:  I'm glad...to receive your fist, Master...
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  Shut up.  Talking makes you die. </font>
    <br>Gehrich:  I gotta tell you...tjhis or...I'll die as a real fool....It's about the Princess Emille in the Castle....She's...a fake....That woman was switched....Ugh...!!
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  Don't say anything! </font>
    <br>Gehrich:  Uhg...!!  The real one is hidden in...the castle.......<i>(Dies)</i>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Picks up Gehrich's dead body)</i>  I'll catch up to you later, I have to entomb him.  <i>(Turns around slowly and leaves)</i></font>
    <br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol: <i>(Turns to Dart)</i> Me wait here.  Bandits may come again. </font>

<p><i>Downstairs</i>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  Lynn!!  Where are you!? </font>
    <br>Lynn:  <i>(From behind prison)</i> Meru!!  Are you here to resuce me!?
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Rushes over to the prison)</i> Of course!  Kate's totally worried about ya!  <i>(Begins pounding on the gate with her fists)</i> Oh no?  <i>(Begins kicking it)</i>  I'm letting you out now!! </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  <i>(Walks over to a lever)</i>  This opens it. <i>(Pulls lever, and the gate opens.  He turns to Meru)</i>  If your brawn doesn't work, you should use your brain. <i>(Rejoins the group)</i></font>
    <br><i>Meru turns to Lynn</i>
    <br>Lynn:  Meru!  Thanks!!  Do you know these people? </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Shrugs)</i>  These are my pals!  We are traveling together for a variety of reasons! </font>
    <br>Lynn:  <i>(Turns to them and bows)</i> You came all the way to such a dangerous place....What great people!!  <i>(Turns and bows again)</i>  Thank you!!  <i>(Turns to Dart)</i> People's courage hasn't dried up yet!
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Shrugs)</i>  You showed it yourself. </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Shrugs)</i>  But, why did you come alone!?  I had lots of things to say to the gang too! </font>
    <br>Lynn: <i>(Turns to Meru)</i>  I wanted to solve this by myself.  Besides, I though I might be able to talk to Gehrich if he hadn't changed.  <i>(Turns to Albert)</i>  But something had changed.  Probably, the person who joined him a half year ago changed Gehrich.
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  And that person is now assuming the form of Princess Emille.  We need to go back to the castle quickly. </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  <i>(Turns around)</i>  That's after we find the stolen Dragoon Spirit. </font>
    <br><i>(Everyone turns to her)</i>
    <br>Lynn:  Any stolen goods should be around here.  They were throwing all the stolen items in here.
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  Now let's split up and look for it. </font>
    <br><i>They begin searching</i>
    <br>Lynn:  It should be somewhere in this room.
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  It should be easiest for you to find it because the Red-Eye Dragon recognizes you. </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  My logic will not work in locating it. </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  Are you really trying? </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  We have to find it as soon as possible because it is a very important memento. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Finds it)</i>  I got it!!  <i>(Everyone turns to him He holds it out and it begins to glow red)</i></font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  Wow!! </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  It seems happy to meet you again. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Turns to the others)</i>  Now let's go back to Fletz and see Princess Lisa and tell her everything! </font>

<p><i>On the upper level, Haschel returns.  Kongol turns to Dart</i>
    <br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol:  Did you find thing? </font>
    <br><i>Dart runs over to him</i>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  It seems you found both Lynn and the Dragoon Spirit. </font>

<p><i>They leave</i>

<p><i>In the Barrens</i>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: <i>(Turns to Lynn)</i> Hey!  We'll be in Donau soon!  Go home quick to her, you handsome man!  Kate's worrying!</font>
    <br>Lynn:  Dart, I cannot thank you enough.  But I have to say it, thank you.  Now Donau is saved.
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Shrugs)</i>  It's just the beginning.  The Mayor must be taking action now, in response to your courage, Lynn. </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  Finally.  That Mayor is taking action. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Nods)</i> thank you for your guidance, Meru. </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  What are you talking about?  It's not over yet. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: What? </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  Dart's journey won't be easy. <i>(Turns, walks off a bit, then turns back to Dart)</i> What you guys do is not normal.  Monsters like Virage appear, Dragoons, Gigantos.  I thought they only existed in fairy tales.  <i>(Shrugs)</i> I can't explain it, but I think there'll be a lot of things I can help you with.  So, why don't we go to Fletz now?  We can't procrastinate like this, right!? </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Shrugs)</i>  It'll continue to be like a traveling three-right circus. </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  All right!! </font>
    <br>Lynn:  I'm going.  <i>(Both Dart and Meru turn to him)</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Nods)</i> Say hello to Kate. </font>
    <br>Lynn:  Please come to our wedding!  I'm having it tomorrow if it's possible!  Bon voyage!!  <i>(Lynn bows and leaves)</i>

<p><i>They leave</i>

<p><i>In Donau, on the day of the wedding</i>
    <br>Man:  Oh?  You are the folks that Lynn invited?  I see.  <i>(Dart nods, and the man turns away from them)</i> Perfect timing.  They are in the middle of the ceremony.

<p><i>In the chapel Kate and Lynn exchange vows and kiss</i>

<p><i>Out of the chapel</i>
    <br>Man:  It's time for the couple to come out.
    <br><i>(Lynn and Kate exit and bow)</i>
    <br>Someone:  Look!  She is throwing the boquet!
    <br><i>(Kate throws the boquet.  Dart moves Shana into its path)</i>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  Yeek!  <i>(Catches it)</i> Thank you. </font>
    <br><i>Dart scratches his head</i>

<p><i>In the Mayor's house</i>
    <br>Mayor of Donau:  Thanks to you, the city reclaimed its peace.  I cannot explain in words how much I appreciate it.
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Turns to him)</i> We just went to get something important back.  <i>(Looks around)</i> It is due to you and your people's effort to bring the city back to normal.</font>
    <br>Mayor of Donau:  No.  It was you who imparted us the courage to do it.  We are wondering if you would like to settle here now that peace has returned.
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Shrugs)</i>  Thank you.  <i>(Begins to leave)</i>  But we have something we have to take care of. </font>
    <br>Mayor of Donau:  I understand.  It is a shame, but you have to do what you have to do.  We don't know what you have to take care of.  But we knot that you can complete anything you want.  Good luck.
    <br>Kate:  I'll be praying here along with the baby I'm expecting.
    <br><i>Dart turns to Kate and Lynn</i>
    <br>Lynn:  Good luck!
    <br><i>Dart waves and leaves</i>

<p><i>As they enter Fletz, a fanfare plays</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  That sound, it can't be. </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: <i>(Nods)</i>  It seems the ceremony for Princess Emille's coming of age celebration has already started. </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: <i>(Shrugs)</i>  We just found out that Princess Emille is a fake. </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  <i>(Runs up to Dart and Albert, who turn to her)</i> It doesn't necessarily mean that the Moon Dagger has already been passed on. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Nods, turns, walks ahead a little, then turns back)</i> Let's go!  <i>(They all run towards the castle)</i></font>
    <br><i>In the castle, the Giant Gate Keeper approaches Dart, who turns to him</i>
    <br>Giant Gate Keeper:  Bad people!  Coming in without permission.  <i>(Walks around them a little)</i>  Just kidding.  I excuse you, because today is such a happy day.
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  When did it start? </font>
    <br>Giant Gate Keeper:  <i>(Nods and turns to the Sun Chamber)</i>  A moment ago.  But just asking doesn't mean you have an invitation.  It's so packed you couldn't fit a penny in.  Look.  <i>(Dart turns to the Sun Chamber)</i>  She suddenly got a lot of hanger-ons.  There are so many new faces that I have never seen before, and according to rumor, they used to be bandits.  See, bad attitude, right?  They cannot call themselves knights, but nobody can say anything because it's Princess Emille.  <i>(Turns to Dart, and he to him)</i>  Oh!!  Don't tell anybody about this!  And I'll let you in.
    <br><i>Dart nods, and the Giant Gate Keeper stands guard at the entrance</i>
    <br><i>Dart, Albert, and Shana approach a "guard"</i>
    <br>Bandit Knight A:  Who the hell are you?  They're busy with an important ceremony.  Don't even think about bothering them.
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Shakes his head)</i>  They are not decent knights...</font>
    <br>Bandit A: <i>(Stands up)</i> Can't you see our armor!?  We are the authentic great Knights of Tiberoa! <i>(Another guard turns towards them)</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Is Princess Emille in there? </font>
    <br><i>Bandit Knight A backs off, and the other guard goes to his side</i>
    <br>Bandit Knight A:  Whoa!  You can't go in there.  It's not a place for commoners like you.  Cuz it's the birthday of our princess!  <i>(Dart goes to draw his sword)</i>  Do you really think you can get away with making a scene like that!?
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  It's special today. </font>
    <br>Bandit Knight B:  Are, are you gonna...make an enemy of all Tiberoa!?
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: <i>(Walks up to Dart)</i> (Seems like bluffing is not working.) </font>
    <br><i>Dart relaxes and nods.  Shana walks up to him</i>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  Can you send a message to Princess Lisa? </font>
    <br>Bandit Knight A:  She's not here!  And it's the birthday of her own sis!  I guess she is keeping herself cooped up in her room!
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Turns and begins to walk away, then turns back to the knights)</i>  I'll be back.  Then I'm going to get past you.</font>
    <br>Bandit Knight:  It  won't make any difference no matter how many times you come back!!  There's important ceremonial stuff going on in there.  Just go away!

<p><i>In tower, if you get caught</i>
    <br>Bandit Knight:  Who are you!?  <i>(Other bandit knights join)</i> Take them out!!

<p><i>At Princess Lisa's room</i>
    <br>Guard:  I cannot let those bandit-like guys contaminate Princess Lisa's room!

<p><i>In Princess Lisa's Room, everyone enters, and Princess Lisa turns to them</i>
    <br>Princess Lisa:  I have been waiting for you, everyone.  <i>(Turns and walks away slightly, then turns back to them)</i>  I am ready.  Please tell me the truth...
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Nods)</i>  The Princess Emille attending the ceremony is a fake.  A woman who is helping the bandits made the switch a half year ago. </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  <i>(Shrugs)</i> The star of Princess Lisa has shown the truth. </font>
    <br>Lisa: <i>(Nods)</i> Oh thank god...It is impossible for my sister Emille to have such an attitude.  <i>(Walks up to Albert)</i>  Now, where is my true sister, Emille!?
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: <i>(Shrugs)</i>  It seems she is confined somewhere in this castle. </font>
    <br>Lisa:  <i>(Backs off)</i>  Confined...somewhere in here?  <i>(Holds hands to her face)</i>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: <i>(Nods)</i>  It was the last words of a dying man....We can trust him. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Nods)</i> It all started out at the time of a horseback ride a half year ago...By taking advantage of the confusion, the mysterious woman switched herself with Princess Emille, and took over Tiberoa with the cooperation of bandits...</font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: <i>(Shrugs)</i>  It's an amazing plot. </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: <i>(Shrugs)</i> The finale was to be the Coming of Age ceremony when the Moon Dagger would be passed down...</font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Takes a step forward)</i> Princes Lisa!  We have to find Princess Emille or we cannot stop the ceremony! </font>
    <br><i>(Lisa nods and relaxes)</i>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  <i>(Dart turns to her)</i> Is it possible to use astrology to find Princess Emille!? </font>
    <br>Lisa: <i>(Dart turns to her)</i> Let me try.  <i>(Lisa takes something out and holds out her arms and a purple light glows ...  she puts it away and shakes her head)</i> All the stars are refusing to tell their story.  As if a mist is covering the night sky.
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Nods)</i> Then we just have to search every nook and cranny...</font>
    <br>Lisa: <i>(Nods)</i>  Let me come with you.  When I am with you, you may be able to avoid some trouble.
    <br><i>Dart nods and they leave</i>

<p><i>If you are caught</i>
    <br>Bandit Knight:  Who are you!?  <i>(Runs up to Dart and another bandit joins.  Princess Lisa appears)</i>  Oops!!  Princess...Lisa...!  <i>(Pauses)</i> You're supposed to be sick, Princess Lisa!  You must stay and rest in your room!  Otherwise, we'll be yelled at by Princess Emille! <i>(Turns to other knight)</i>  Hey!!  Take them to their rooms!!

<p><i>At entrance to Sun Chamber</i>

    <br>Bandit Knight:  Oops!  Princess Lisa!!  Are you already fealing better...Hee...
    <br>Lisa:  <i>(Walks up to Bandit Knight)</i>  Shall I go in?
    <br>Bandit Knight:  <i>(Shakes his head)</i>  We cannot...
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Walks up to Bandit Knight)</i>  Why is that!? </font>
    <br>Bandit Knight:  We were told that nobody, not even Princess Lisa, can come in til the Moon Dagger is passed on...
    <br><i>(Princess Lisa turns to Dart and shakes her head.  They head off to Emille's room)</i>

<p><i>At Emille's Room, Dart approaches a couple of Bandit Knights</i>
    <br>Bandit Knight:  If you wanna talk to Princess Emille, go to the Chamber of the Sun!  <i>(Princess Lisa appears)</i> Oh, Pr, Princess Lisa...!?  How are you feeling...?
    <br>Lisa: <i>(Nods)</i>  I feel much better.  I have to go in to my sister Emille's room.  Can I come in?
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  <i>(Looks over the railing)</i> It's far away from the bottom of the tower. </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  Screams won't be heard down there...Why don't' we settle this here? </font>
    <br><i>They all turn to the guards, who run off</i>
    <br>Bandit Knight:  Damn it!!
    <br>Lisa: <i>(Approaches the doorway)</i>  Shall we go?  If the real sister Emille is in this castle, she must be somewhere in this room.
    <br><i>(They enter the room, which is a complete mess)</i>
    <br>Lisa:  It is awful...
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Kneels down)</i>  Somebody looted the place...</font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  <i>(Nods)</i>  That makes this room even more suspicious.  We might find something here to help us find Princess Emille....
        <br><i>Meru turns to the doorway</i></font>
    <br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol:  Kongol go outside, watch. </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  Kongol is too big for this room. <i>(Turns to the others, and Haschel turns to her)</i> I feel sorry for him.  I'm gonna wait with Kongol!  <i>(Leaves)</i></font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: <i>(Turns to Dart, and Dart to him)</i> I'm going too. There are too many people in this room.  <i>(Leaves)</i></font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Nods)</i>  Let's split up and search. </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  Again, it's something to do with the moon.  The words of Emperor Doel.  I might be able to better understand the words  "find the girl by the time the Moon That Never Sets waxes...".</font>
    <br>Lisa:  We have to hurry up or a national treasure of Tiberoa will be lost!
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  <i>(Shakes her head)</i> I feel something in this room. </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  What a mess....There should be some trace in here. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Goes up to portrait of Emille)</i>(Touches it, and it flashes and everyone disappears)</i></font>
    <br><i>Meru and Haschel enter the room</i>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  What was that noise!?  <i>(Turns to Haschel)</i>  There's nobody here! </font>

<p><i>Inside the portrait</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Where are we...?  What on earth has happened!? </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  <i>(Walks around)</i>  It seems a Magical space was created in the painting.  It seems peculiar...</font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Shrugs)</i> This is "magic"!? </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(From other side of portrait, and everyone turns to her)</i> Dart!  Where are you!? </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Takes a step forward)</i> We are in the painting!! </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  Haschel!  They must be talking about this! </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: <i>(Takes a step forward)</i>  Don't touch the painting!  It seems to be linked to the world over here! </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  I got it! </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Turns around, then sees on another platform Emille, who is sitting in a chair asleep)</i>  Look!! </font>
    <br>Lisa:  <i>(Runs to the edge of the platform, but Dart stops her)</i>  Emille!!  Sister Emille!!
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  It is too dangerous to go!! </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  <i>(Walks up to Dart)</i>  Oh...She is Princess Emille...</font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  <i>(Kneels and looks over the edge of the platform and Dart turns to her)</i>  It is linked with a different dimension...It is too dangerous to jump over. <i>(Gets up)</i></font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  She is right in front of us....How can we?</font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  We have no time to waste or the Moon Dagger will be handed over. </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  I got it!  We can help her if we turn ourselves into Dragoons!  <i>(Goes to transform, but it's rejected and she stumbles a little)</i></font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Are you all right!? </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  <i>(Shakes her head)</i>  It's hard to transform myself into a Dragoon unless it is during battle.  <i>(Turns away)</i>  Besides...This magic is rejecting the Dragoons...</font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Lowers his head and shakes it)</i>  What should we do!? </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  Princess Emille!!  Please wake up!!  <i>(Shakes his head)</i>  We are so close to rescuing her...</font>
    <br>Lisa:  Oh, Emille...Why don't you wake up...
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Approaches a strange glowing light and touches it)</i> Look... <i>(Everyone turns and watches as a red light forms a bridge)</i>   We can cross now!! </font>
    <br><i>Lisa, Albert, Dart, and Shana all rush over to Princess Emille</i>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  Princess Emille! </font>
    <br>Lisa: <i>(Kneels in front of her and shakes her shoulders)</i> Sister!  Sister!!  Sister Emille!!  Please wake up!!  <i>(Continues to shake her shoulders)</i>  I cannot wake her!
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  <i>(Turns to Lisa, who gets up)</i> Let me do it!  <i>(Goes to Emille and throws out his arms)</i> Princess Emille!!  Wake up!!  Wake up at once or something irrecovable will happen to Tiberoa!! </font>
    <br>Emille:  Ah...Ahh...
    <br>Lisa:  <i>(Walks up to her)</i>  Oh Emille!!
    <br><i>(A light flashes and Emille awakens)</i>
    <br>Emille:  Lisa...And you...?  Where...am I?
    <br>Lisa:  You have been sleeping for the past six months since we went for a horseback ride, sister.
    <br>Emille:  A half year?  I was sleeping...the half year since the horseback ride... <i>(Stands up, and Albert and Lisa take a step back)</i> What about the Coming of Age ceremony!?  Yes...what about the Moon Dagger!?
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Walks up to her)</i>  It is about the be passed over to another person! </font>
    <br>Emille: <i>(Walks up to him)</i>  Can you explain that to me?  About this other person and you?
    <br><i>Dart nods and tells her the story</i>
    <br>Emille: <i>(Nods)</i>  It seems I've troubled you a lot due to my absence.  <i>(Walks over to the bridge, and turns to them and nods)</i> Let us go to the Chamber of the Sun.  We have to let people know the truth.
    <br><i>They leave</i>

<p><i>If you are caught</i>
    <br>Bandit Knight:  Who are you!?  <i>(Runs up to Dart, another Bandit Knight appears.  Princess Emille comes out)</i>  Pr, Princess Emille!?  Wh, Why are you here!?
    <br>Emille:  Thank you for your work.  My Coming of Age ceremony is still being held in the Chamber of the Sun, isn't it?
    <br>Bandit Knight:  Ye, Yes your highness!!
    <br><i>They turn aside and let her pass.  Dart turns to them, puts his hands on his hips, and turns back and leaves)</i>
    <br>Bandit Knight A:  How graceful...
    <br>Bandit Knight B:  There is no comparison with the fake one...
    <br>Bandit Knight A:  Hey!!  There is no time for this!! Our plan is not working anymore!!
    <br>Bandit Knight B:  We gotta run!!
    <br><i>All the guards leave</i>

<p><i>In the castle, both Princess Emille and Princess Lisa appear in front of another Bandit Knight</i>
    <br>Bandit Knight:  Oops!!  It's Princess E, Emille...!?
    <br>Emille:  <i>(Walks up to the guard)</i>  Did I make it in time for the ceremony?
    <br>Bandit Knight: <i>(Backs off)</i>  Ye, Yes!!  <i>(Backs off, then runs away)</i>
    <br>Emille:  <i>(Turns to Dart)</i>  Shall we go?

<p><i>At the doorway where the Giant Gate Keeper is</i>
    <br>Giant Gate Keeper:  Princess Emille!!??  Why are you here...I thought you're in the middle of your Coming of Age ceremony...
    <br>Emille:  <i>(Turns to him)</i>  No.  My ceremony has not started yet.
    <br>Giant Gate Keeper:  Then the Princess Emille in that chamber is...not...
    <br>Emille: <i>(Nods)</i>  You are right.  I am the true Princess Emille.  I am about the reveal everything.
    <br>Giant Gate Keeper:  <i>(Falls to his butt)</i>  Aw!!  I cannot get up!!  I'm just so overcome with happiness!!
    <br>Emille:  Oh...You are exaggerating...<i>(Turns to the door, then to Dart)</i>  Shall we,  Dart?
    <br></i>They leave</i>

<p><i>In the Chamber of the Sun</i>
    <br>King Zior: <i>IStands up from this throne and holds out his arms)</i>  You've been filled with 20 years of experience since you came into this world.  You have reached the age that deserves the succession of the Moon Dagger as an heir to the throne of Tiberoa.  Never forget the blessings of the Sun, Moon and Stars.  <i>(Lowers his arms and looks around)</i>  Anybody!!  Are there any objections!?  <i>(Nods)</i>  I assume this silence to be the approval of the succession.
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Wait!!</font>
    <br><i>Dart, Emille, and Lisa enter</i>
    <br>Emille:  I have an objection to the succession!
    <br>King Zior:  <i>(Looks at both Emilles)</i>  Oh my god!?  There are two Emilles!!
    <i>(The fake Emille backs off as Dart comes closer.  She turns and jumps at King Zior, steals the Moon Dagger, and jumps over to the balcony)</i>
    <br>King Zior:  !!  The Moon Dagger! <i>(Turns to the others and shakes his head)</i> What is going on!?
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Throws his fist up)</i>  King Zior!  That girl is a fake!</font>
    <br>Emille:  I have been put into a sleep for the last half year.  <i>(Walks up to the fake Emille)</i> During that time, it seems this person was making a variety of social missteps.
    <br>Lisa: <i>(Walks over to King Zior)</i>  Father!  That woman was going to take over Tiberoa, by forming a conspiracy with the Gehrich Gang!
    <br>King Zior:  Oh my god!?
    <br>Fake Princess Emille:  <i>(Dusts herself off, the other turn to her)</i>  Huh!!  I guess you found out about everything!!  Don't ya think it's too late?  I got this in my hand.
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Takes a step towards her)</i> Look around yourself. </font>
    <br><i>Albert and Rose appear with weapons in hand)</i>
    <br>Fake Princess Emille:  <i>(Looks to them and backs off a little)</i> You think I'm cornered, huh?
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Who are you? </font>
    <br>Fake Princess Emille:  <i>(Turns away from them, crosses arms)</i>  I guess I cannot run in this stuffy dress.  <i>(Walks up to Dart)</i>  This will be a treat!  Let me show ya my true self!!
    <br><i>(Magic, and a bright light erupts, revealing the true form)</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: !! </font>
    <br>Lenus:  Surprised, huh?  This is the true self of Miss Lenus!
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Turns to Emille)</i>  Princess Emille!!  Plrease leave the room with the King and Princess Lisa!! </font>
    <br><i>Emille nods, and they leave.  Dart draws his sword and turns to Lenus</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  The Gehrich Gang has fallen apart!  Give us the Moon Dagger! </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  <i>(Points his spear at Lenus)</i> The only chance you have is to give up. </font>
    <br>Lenus:  <i>(Shrugs)</i>  A girl in love doesn't know the meaning of the words "give up"!  <i>(Turns, walks over to the edge of the balcony, then turns back)</i>  I have managed to get this for my love.  I won't give this up so easily.
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: <i>(Points her rapier at Lenus)</i>  I'm sorry but you don't' have time to be in love anymore.  Because you will die here. </font>
    <br>Lenus:  <i>(Throws her arm)</i.><i>Battle begins</i>
<p></i>During battle</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Notices her wings)</i> !?  What the heck is on her back!? </font>

<p><i>After Black Rain and Dart Mist attack</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: What the heck was that attack? </font>

<p><i>After battle</i>

    <br>Lenus:  <i>(Shakes her head)</i>  You are not bad, I guess....
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: <i>(Points his spear at her)</i>  Give us the Moon Dagger.  Don't waste your time on this meaningless battle. </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Nods)</i>  Gehrich is already dead.
        <br>Lenus:  <i>(Shakes her head)</i>  Gehrich!?  I didn't care about the man from the beginning!  I told ya!?  I need the Moon Dagger for my love! </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Points his sword at her, and she turns to him)</i>  Admit your defeat.  There is no way to escape. </font>
    <br>Lenus:  No way to escape, huh!?  <i>(Points to Meru)</i>  Hey you over there!  What do you think of that!?
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: ...</font>
    <br>Lenus:  <i>(Shakes her head)</i>  Whatever!  <i>(Dart turns to Lenus)</i>  See for yourself!  <i>(Runs over to the balcony and jumps over it)</i>  Is there no way to escape?!  <i>(Flies back up with her Wings of Light and turns back to them)</i>  Bye now!!  <i>(Turns and flies away)</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Wait!! </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  <i>(Sets his spear aside)</i>  Oh no...She is a Wingly!? </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  <i>(Punches the air)</i>  The species that dominated the bygone world...<i>(Turns to the others)</i>  She's a survivor. </font>
    <br>King Zior:  <i>(Enters from the back)</i>  "People of magic who run across the sky with wings"...Was she here to take it back from Humans?

<p><i>Later, the King and Two princesses are seated in the Chamber of the Sun with Dart and Albert at the bottom of the stage</i>

    <br>King Zior:  You are the King of Serdio, Albert.  Why did you take such a risk?
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: <i>(Nods)</i>  It might be self-gratification.  However, I would like to settle my friend's score, with my own hands.  <i>(Shrugs)</i>  We are pursuing a man who manipulated the war with Serdio from behind the scenes.  My friend was killed by that man.  At the same time, the Moon Gem, which belonged to Serdio, was taken away.  <i>(Turns to Dart and nods, then back to the king)</i>  We have different reasons, however we are all linked to that man, and here we are. </font>
    <br>King Zior:  You said the Moon Gem.  It is a legacy of the Winglies, isn't it?
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: <i>(nods)</i>  Could you please tell us about the Moon Dagger Your Majesty? </font>
    <br>King Zior:  <i>(Stands up and takes a few steps forward)</i>  It was after the Dragon Campaign.  Humans defeated the Winglies and built Serdio, Tiberoa, and Mille Seseau.  They say the few surviving Winglies sent a divine object of the moon as a proof of peace to the three countries.  That's all I know about the legend.
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  <i>(Shrugs)</i>  We have the same legend in my country.  What is dangerous is that we Humans don't know what the divine moon object is for. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Nods)</i> You mean the Winglies know everything and formed this entire conspiracy? </font>
    <br>Emille:  <i>(Stands up and walks over to King Zior, who turns to her)</i>  Emille.  Father.  We have to take the Moon Dagger back.  <i>(Walks down a few stairs and looks out at the balcony)</i>  Before the starts that have beheld Tiberoa, are lost in a shadow.
    <br>King Zior: <i>(Nods, and Emille turns to him)</i>  It seems that girl of the Winglies got away to Illlisa Bay.  Now, it's time for an appearance by Commodore Puler.  <i>(Turns to Dart)</i>  I will send the most powerful warship that Tiberoa has, the Queen Fury.  Have Commodore Puler pursue her.  Of course, you are more than welcome to be on the boat.
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Nods)</i>  I appreciate it, Your Majesty. </font>
    <br>King Zior:  <i>(Nods)</i> It was the first time I've seen a Wingly.  But they seem to be beyond our power...so that...we might need your help.
    <br><i>(Dart nods, and Emille walks forward to Albert)</i>
    <br>Emille:  Please take care of yourselves.
    <br><i>(Albert walks up to her and nods)</i>

<p><i>In Donau, at the dock</i>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  Is this a ship? </font>
    <br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol:  <i>(Crosses his arms)</i>  Kongol is excited. This bigger than me. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  So, this is the Queen Fury? </font>
    <br>Kayla: !?  <i>(Walks up to them)</i>  You must be Dart!?
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Nods)</i>  Yes, I am, and you? </font>
    <br>Kayla:  My name is Kayla!  I'm a crew member on the Queen Fury!  I'm getting the Commodore now!  <i>(Runs back to the ship)</i>  Commodore!!  Commodore Puler!!  Dart and his friends are here!
    <br>Puler: What Kayla!?  Be quiet!  <i>(Walks up to her)</i>  A man of the sea should have a big heart.  <i>(Looks out to the sea)</i>  Sometimes you listen to the waves, and cast your dreams to the ocean.  That is a man's romance!!
    <br>Kayla:  <i>(Jumps)</i>  Commodore!  Dart and his friends are here!  You got an order form the King didn't you sir?  <i>(Goes into the ship)</i>
    <br>Puler:  <i>(Runs up to Dart and the others)</i>  Oh!  You are the brave young people who routed the bandits!  You deserve to be guests on my ship!  The Queen Fury!
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Thank you.  But we don't want to be treated as guests.  We have the same objective, to pursue Lenus. </font>
    <br>Puler:  Hmm!!  I like that!!
    <br>Kayla:  <i>(Exits the ship)</i>  We are ready to go, sir!!
    <br>Puler:  <i>)Turns to Kayla)</i>  I see.  Now the only thing left is for you to board.  <i>(Turns back to Dart)</i>  As soon as you are ready, we will hit the ocean!!
    <br><i>Dart goes up to Kayla</i>
    <br>Kayla:  We have been waiting for you!  Are you ready to go?
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Please wait a little. </font>
    <br>Kayla:  Please hurry up!  Or we will lose the person we are pusuing!
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Yes. </font>
    <br>Kayla:  Now, let's set sail!!
    <br><i>The ship sounds its horn and they leave</i>

<p><i>On the ship</i>
    <br><i>Rose is on the crow's nest looking out as birds fly around</i>
    <br><i>(Shana is on deck, streches, spins, and looks at the birds)</i>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  <i>(Talking to a bird perched nearby)</i>  Many things have happened.  I was put in jail...and Dart came rescue me....We were with Lavitz.  And now we are here, pursuing Lloyd.  <i>(Puts hands to face and looks down)</i>  There are so many things I don't understand.  The Moon That Never Sets, the voice of Virage....<i>(Looks at the birds and holds out her arms)</i>  I wish I could fly like you guys.  <i>(All the birds fly away)</i>  But it doesn't take me anywhere. ......Dart will laugh at me.  <i>(Puts her hand to her chin)</i>  Dart, I wonder where he went? </font>

<p><i>To Kongol, who is below deck watching the workers fuel the ship</i>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  Hi, have you seen Dart?  <i>(Kongol shakes his head)</i>  I'll look somewhere else then. </font>

<p><i>To Albert, who is in the ship's lounge listening to the waves</i>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  Have you seen Dart? </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  <i>(Stands and turns to her)</i>  No.  I thought you were with him. </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  <i>(Turns away a moment, then turns back to Albert)</i>  No, um...?  What are you doing Albert? </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  When you listen to the sound of the waves, you feel like the world is breating.  It's very comfortable so I closed my eyes. </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  You are a poet.  I'll look somewhere else.</font>

<p><i>In the kitchen</i>

    <br>Sailor: Oh, Miss Shana/ Mr. Dart / Miss Rose/ Mr. Haschel  Say, How about having a Julienne Vegetable Match with me?
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  Let's play!  I am good at cooking. / Sorry, I have something else to do. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Okay, deal!  I am good with knives. / No thanks.  I'm busy now. </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  Hm, I'll play.  At least I can kill some time. / No thanks. </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  Let's play!  I'll show you my experience! / Sorry, I'm not in the mood now. </font>
    <br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol:  Kongol plays.  Gigantos nimble. / Kongol doesn't play.  Kongol busy. </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  I understand, I'll play.  This is my first experience cooking.  I don't have any confidence. / I am sorry, but I am not interested. </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  I'll do it, I'll do it!  I'm totally awesome at anything! / Um, sorry.  I don't' feel like it now. </font>
    <br>Sailor:  Oh, you want to play with me!  The Vegetable Julienne Contest!  It's my passion!  It's my life!!  It's my work!!!  Please wait while I get ready.  / I see, I understand.  When you would like to play, call me.

<p><i>After game</i>
    <br>Sailor:  Oh no!  Miss Shana/ Mr. Dart /Miss Rose/Mr. Haschel/Mr. Kongol/Mr. Albert. Miss Meru won.
    <br>Sailor:  Ha ha ha, I won!

<p>Sailor:  Well, well, thank you for helping with my work.  It's nothing but this is something for you.  <i>(Gives you one Gold piece)</i>

<p><i>To Meru, who is lying on a bed</i>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  What you doing in here? </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Gets up and turns to her)</i>  I'm just bored!  <i>(Pauses)</i>  You know what!?  Let's have a pillow fight! </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  Sorry.  I'm a little bit buys now. </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  You are boring!  <i>(Lies back down)</i></font>

<p><i>To Haschel, who is on the upper deck meditating</i>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  Haschel? </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: ...</font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: [He is contemplating, I should disturb him.] </font>

<p><i>To Rose</i>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: Umm...Rose. </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  <i>(Turns to Shana)</i>  Do you need me? </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  <i>(Shrugs)</i>  I don't need anything from you in particular, but I was just wondering how you are doing? </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  <i>(Turns away)</i>  I was thinking about Dart. </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:   <i>(Holds her hands to her face)</i>  !! </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  Just kidding.  <i>(Turns back to the ocean)</i></font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: ...</font>

<p><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  [Here you are, Dart.] </font>

<p><i>To Dart</i>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  Hi, Dart.  <i>(Pauses)</i>  Dart?</font>
    <br>Puler:  <i>(Turns to her)</i>  When Humans go to sea, there is a lot to hink about.  Friendship, love, life and romance!  <i>(Shana turns to him)</i>  Porobably Dart's heart is wandering in the mother ocean.
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: <i>(Turns back to Dart)</i> [Such a scary face.  He must be thinking about the Black Monster.] </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Gets up and turns to her)</i>  Oh, Shana....Is something wrong? </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: <i>(Pauses, then shrugs)</i>  I have been thinking too.  About the past and future.  <i>(Turns away)</i>  And about you and me....</font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  You and me? </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  <i>(Turns back to him)</i>  Eventually, our journey will end. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Turns away)</i>  Yes, eventually.  But....I wonder where we will be? </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  I want to be next to you, Dart. <i>(Dart turns to her, but she turns away)</i> But....Nobody knows about the future.  <i>(Runs off)</i></font>
    <br>Puler:  <i>(Turns to Dart)</i>  Love and sailing are alike. <i>(Dart turns to him)</i>  If you don't swim against the waves and just enjoy it, you will overcome it.  <i>(Pauses)</i>  Thinking alone is sometimes good.  But sometimes, when you listen to others, your way will open up.  <i>(Turns back to the helm)</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Turns away and crosses arms)</i>  [The Black Monster, I still don't know anything about it.  Maybe, Rose might know something about it.] </font>

<p><i>To Haschel</i>

    <font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: ...</font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: [I guess it's not time for him to talk.] </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Turns to him)</i> I dunno.  <i>(Pauses)</i> </font> Anyway, I'm totally bored!!  Hang out with me! Hang out with me! </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Next time.  <i>(Begins to leave)</i></font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  It's totally boring!  I'm gonna tell Shana that you were looking for Rose!  <i>(Lies back down)</i></font>

<p><i>To Albert</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Have you seen Rose? </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  <i>(Stands up, turns to him)</i>  No.  But....Are you going to ask that question to everyone? </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Yeah. </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  To Shana too?  <i>(Pauses, then turns away)</i> The Human heart is more complicated than waves.  <i>(Sits back down)</i></font>

<p><i>To Kongol</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  What are you looking at? </font>
    <br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol:  <i>(Crosses arms)</i>  Flame.  The life that drives such a big thing.  <i>(Unfolds arms)</i>  You will be a flame that drives big thing.  <i>(Turns away)</i></font>

<p><i>To Shana, who is on the lower deck watching the birds</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Have you seen Rose? </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: <i>(Turns to him)</i>  I don't know.  <i>(Pauses)</i> You need her for something? </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Well, it's not that important. </font>
    <br><i>Shana turns away</i>

<p><i>To Rose</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: [Here you are, Rose.]  <i>(Goes up to her)</i>  Here you are. </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  May I help you? </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  It's about the Black Monster.  I though you might know something about it, Rose. </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  <i>(Turns to him)</i> That's right.  You are traveling just for that....<i>(Turns away)</i>  Unfortunately, I have nothing to tell you. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Shrugs)</i> Oh....</font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  <i>(Turns back to him)</i> What you going to do when you catch the Black Monster, what are you going to do with him?  <i>(Turns her head a little)</i> Kill him to avenge your parents?  That'll satisfy your feelings? </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Turns away)</i>  "Revenge does not generate anything."  That's what I learned from Lavitz.  <i>(Rose turns to him)</i>  To tell you the truth, I don't know what I'm going to do...or even what I want to do when I face the Black Monster.  <i>(Turns back to Rose)</i> I just want to know what he is. </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: <i>(Turns away)</i> I see....Well, I can tell you one thing.  <i>(Pauses)</i>  Do you know what is the source of the power of Dragoons?  <i>(Dart shakes his head, and Rose turns to the side)</i> War is not in human nature.  Humans fight by making themselves enter insanity.  It is ...the same for revenge.  <i>(Holds out her Dragoon Spirit and watches it glow)</i>  This is a tool to amplify the insanity.  And this insanity is the source of the power of Dragoons, the Dragon Knight. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  I didn't know that....</font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  Someday, something will happen, and if you cannot chasten your insanity, I wonder if you will be able to endure it, given the size of your spirit?  <i>(Pauses, puts her Dragoon Spirit away, and turns back to the sea)</i>  Sorry.  It was just nonsense. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  It's okay.  When I finish with Lloyd, I'll go on my journey to pursue the Black Monster.  <i>(He turns away, and Rose looks at him)</i>  When I face him, I'll find my own answer to that. </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  <i>(Rose leans against the side of the crow's nest and watches him leave)</i></font>
    Mine is not a "journey"....I'll take a walk for a change.

<p><i>To Dart</i>
    <br>Puler:  Dart is popular with girls.  He is well suited to be a man of the sea.
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: <i>(Turns to Puler)</i>  I don't need Dart. </font>
    <br>Puler:  Then...?
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: <i>(Turns away)</i>  I don't need you either. </font>
    <br><i>Puler turns away</i>

<p><i>To Meru</i>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  You look bored. </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Turns to her)</i>  Exactly!!  Can we hang out together? </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  If you want to practice your sword, I can give you one. </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Puts her hands behind her head)</i>  </font>Um....Ah....I think I'll hang out by myself. </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  Okay.  It's unfortunate though. <i>(Turns to leave)</i></font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: (Nyah!!!) </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: <i>(Turns back to her)</i>  I can give you some practice if you want. </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  No thanks!  No thanks!  I'll behave!!  <i>(Lies back down)</i></font>

<p><i>To Albert</i>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  Can I ask you what you are doing? </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: <i>(Stands up and turns to her)</i>  I was debating with myself as to which is more profound, the sea or love?  Now, I am debating with myself which is more infinite, the sea or love? </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  <i>(Turns away a moment, then turns back to him)</i>  I see....Sounds like fun. </font>
    <br><i>Albert sits back down</i>

<p><i>To Kongol</i>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  I wonder if Gigantos like dark places? </font>
    <br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol:  Gigantos have hid from humans.  Kongol feels at ease in dark places. </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: ...<i>(Turns away)</i> Sorry for disturbing you. </font>

<p><i>To Shana</i>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  Am I disturbing you?  </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  ...If you are asking about Dart, I have nothing to tell you. </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  <i>(Turns away)</i>  I am not asking any such thing. </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: <i>(Turns back to the sea)</i>  Oh, okay. </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  <i>(Turns to Shana)</i>  [I used to be this innocent.]  <i>(Pauses)</i>  If anything happens, never let Dart go.  <i>(Shana turns to her)</i>  I guess I was nosy.  <i>(Turns away)</i></font>

<p><i>To Haschel</i>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  [Haschel....]  Are you thinking about something? </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Gets up and turns to her)</i> Oh, Rose.  Do you want to talk about your love? </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  <i>(Turns away from him)</i>  I was just walking around and happened to be here. </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Turns to the side)</i>  Can I ask you one thing? </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  Sure. </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Turns to her)</i> You, why are you with us?  <i>(Pauses)</i> I heard that in the beginning it was Dart's Dragoon Spirit.  It seems that's not all. </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  I guess....  <i>(Turns away from him even more)</i> Maybe this journey is just a little break for me....</font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Turns to the side)</i>  "Break," hmm.  Well, everybody has different objectives on the journey.  <i>(Turns to her)</i>  But you, you look like you're rushing yourself to death, with your life being run by something. </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  <i>(Turns to him)</i>  It's none of your business.   <i>(Leaves)</i></font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Turns back to the sea)</i>  I guess I was involved too much.  <i>(Laughs)</i> I cannot make judgments about other people.  <i>(Sits back down and mediates again)</i></font>

<p><i>Flashback  to Haschel's hometown 25 years ago, two women are fighting with Haschel looking on</i>

    <br>Woman: Taa!
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  Claire!! <i>(Fighting stops)</i> Your steps during the attack are slow!!  Take more precise, faster steps!! </font>
    <br>Claire:  <i>(Turns to him)</i>  Yes, Father.
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Throws his arms in the air)</i> You idiot!  During the training, don't think of me as your "Father"!  Call me "Master"! </font>
    <br>Claire:  I am sorry, Master.  <i>(Goes back to fighting)</i>

<p><i>Black screen</i>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  Claire....You, my daughter, were the only heir to our ancestral Rouge School martial art. </font>

<p><i>Back to flashback</i>
    <br><i>More fighting</i>
    <br>Claire: Yaa!
    <br>Woman: Here!
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Claire!!  You cannot take over the Rouge School with such pathetic skills!! </font>
    <br>Claire:  Daa!  <i>(More fighting ensues, and Claire punches the other woman in the face and knocks her out, dead)</i>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: <i>(Runs over to the dead woman)</i>  You implanted a murderous intention in your fist, didn't you!? </font>
    <br>Claire:  <i>(Kneels by the woman, and Haschel turns to her)</i>  Oh Lotta....What's wrong?  <i>(Puts hands to head)</i>  Lotta?  What's wrong!?  Oh!  Lotta!?
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Stands up and throws his arms in the air)</i>  Get out of my sight!! </font>
    <br>Claire:  Lotta....
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Throws his arms in the air)</i>  Get out of my sight!!  <i>(He chases Claire away)</i></font>

<p><i>Flashback ends</i>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: ... <i>(Stands up)</i> I shouted out of anger.  <i>(Looks to the sky)</i> I was just running away from the pain that we have to overcome together, as a Master and as a Father.  <i>(Looks ahead)</i>  It's been 20 years since I left the village pursuing Claire, but what I have found was only my immaturity.  <i>(Pauses)</i>  As time goes by, I forget the objectives of my journey.  <i>(Turns to the side)</i>  But Dart and the others gave me a new one.  <i>(Nods)</i>  I think...what I am going through now is a journey to support the passion of young Dart and his friends.  <i>(Pauses)</i>  Oops!  Oops!  I have become too mushy!  <i>(Pauses)</i>  Well, maybe I'll go tease Kongol!  I hope he is not knocked out with seasickness! </font>

<p><i>To Dart</i>
    <br>Puler:  When Humans go to sea, there is a lot to think about.  Friendship, love, it's bottomless.  <i>(Haschel turns to him, and he to him)</i> But that is life, but that is life.  Dart is now feeling the mystery of life.

<p><i>To Rose</i>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  I like sea air. </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  I agree.  It reminds me of many things...And it makes me forget about things. </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  If it becomes too much to deal with by yourself, you are welcome to come here.  I'll listen to you. </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  ....I appreciate your offer. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  Doel....It was your objective for the journey, wasn't it?  <i>(Begins to leave)</i>  Hmm, then why don't you talk to Albert?  He might know something about Doel's story from the past.  <i>(Leaves)</i></font>
    <br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol:  King of Human....</font>

<p><i>To Dart </i>
    <br>Puler:  When Humans go to sea, there is a lot to think about.  Friendship, love, life and....<i>(Kongol turns to Puler, and he to him, and then Kongol turns away)</i>  I wanted to talk about Romance too.  <i>(Turns back to the helm)</i>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  My Uncle Does was your friend...wasn't he? </font>
    <br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol:  No.  I fight for Emperor Doel.  To make a world where all the species equal. </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  <i>(Turns around)</i>  Maybe we can put it this way.  Maybe "friends" are the people who walk the same road.  <i>(Walks away a little)</i> People who walk together, but not led by somebody, who share happiness and pain. </font>
    <br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol:  <i>(Turns to Albert and crosses arms)</i>  That is friends...?</font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: <i>(Turns to Kongol)</i> Yes.  That is us now.  <i>(Shrugs)</i>  Although we have different objectives, we are walking side by side.  Kongol.  You are walking on the same road as us. </font>

    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: <i>(Turns to him)</i> I cannot follow him all the time.  But....Being alone like this...<i>(Turns back to the sea)</i> makes me feel the five years of Dart's absence never happened.  We are giving a hard journey, but I feel much happier than back then.  <i>(Turns back to Albert)</i></font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  I wonder if even a hard journey can be easily endured when you have a loved one at your side. </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: <i>(Turns to the side)</i>  "Loved one".... I still don't know what Dart thinks about me.  <i>(Turns back to the sea)</i></font>

    <br>Puler:  When Humans go to sea, there is a lot to think about.  Friendship, love, life....
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: <i>(Turns to Puler)</i> and romance....The ocean stimulates people's imagination.  <i>(Puler turns to him)</i>  How wonderful and, at the same time, dangerous a thing it is. </font>
    <br>Puler:  That's a poet.  You see through to the real ocean.  <i>(Turns back to the helm)</i>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: No.  But I now have a question. </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Jumps off the bed and gets in his face)</i> Wow!?  The exciting question time!? </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  Meru, when you joined us, you said "There is still something I can help with".  Is that true? </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: <i>(Turns away and puts her arms behind her head)</i>  Umm...Let me see.  I dunno why but I really feel that way.  It's true.  <i>(Turns back to Albert)</i>  But, I dunno what it is. </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: <i>(Pause)</i> You are not just kidding it seems.  <i>(Turns around)</i> Our jouney is a dangerous one.  We will not be able to succeed, if we take a lackadaisical attitude towards it.  <i>(Takes a step)</i> Therefore, I wanted to make sure one more time.  I don't want to see anybody else dying.  <i>(Turns to Meru)</i> Now, please excuse me.  <i>(Leaves)</i></font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  Whatever.  The King became to serious.  <i>(Throws fist into air)</i> Now is my big chance!!  To hang out with Dart!! </font>

<p><i>To Kongol</i>

    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  Do you think it's strange?  Not being together once in a while makes me realize many things. </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: <i>(Turns away)</i> Really?  It's too difficult for me. </font>

    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: <i>(Turns to Dart)</i>  I want to go too.  <i>(Everyone turns to her)</i> I don't know why, but I want to know about this ship!  Oh please! </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: <i>(Shrugs)</i>  We'll go with them. Then, it won't be a problem. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Turns to Albert, then to Shana)</i>  Okay, but if anything happens we gotta go back. </font>

<p><i>Dart explores the upper room, and a ghost appears at the far door</i>
    <br>Sailor Ghost:  Captain, please open here.  Where are you, Captain?  <i>(Fades away)</i>

<p><i>Dart goes back</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: !?  <i>(Ghost appears behind him, and Dart turns to him with sword in hand)</i></font>
    <br>Ghost Crew A:  Help me....The bastard...the bastard is....<i>(Pauses)</i>  I don't want to...die.  H...Help.  <i>(Fades)</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: What!? </font>
    <br>Ghost Crew B: <i>(Appears behind Dart)</i>  We...cannot make it.  We'll be killed by him.  <i>(Dart turns to him)</i>  I don't want to die.  H...Help.  <i>(Fades)</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Puts sword away)</i> What are they talking about? </font>

<p><i>As Dart goes below deck, a purple ghost laughs and flies into a room</i>

<p><i>In room, Dart goes up the ladder onto a ledge with a chest and opens it</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: !? </font>
    <br><i>The purple ghost flies out, and Dart jumps off the ledge with his sword in hand.  The purple ghost laughs, and awakens the three skeletons</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: !? </font>
    <br><i>They crawl to Dart and the battle begins</i>

<p><i>After the battle, the skeletons fall back to the ground</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Puts his sword away)</i>  That was close. </font>

<p><i>In next room, Dart goes up to the chest. As he opens it, it begins to shake</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: !! </font>
    <br><i>The purple ghost flies out and laughs, then awakens the two skeletons to battle Dart with him</i>

<p><i>After the battle, the two skeletons drop and the Magician Bogey flies out of the room</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  It ran away! </font>

<p><i>Dart goes into the last room and touches a button.  Four ghosts appear and give him four different numbers</i>
    <br>Voice:  May evil come to the person who attempts to solve the riddle of the number.
    <br><i>Dart goes over to the chest.  It shakes and jumps around the room as Dart draws his sword</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  !!  <i>(Watches it jump)</i>  Is it trying to say something?  <i>(Puts sword away and goes over to the chest and draws his sword)</i>  We cornered it!!</font>
    <br><i>(The chest opens and three Magician Bogies pop out, laugh and encircle Dart)</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: !?</font>

<p><i>Battle begins</i>

<p><i>After the battle, the bogies disappear and a small spirit comes out of the chest</i>
    <br>Ghost Captain:  I have a favor to ask you.  Please come to the captain's cabin.  <br><i>(Disappears and Dart puts his sword away</i>

<p><i>In Captain's Cabin, Dart and the others look up at a portrait</i>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  Wow!  A portrait of a beautiful woman.  It seems like the queen of some country. </font>
    <br><i>(The door slams shut)</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  It closed by itself! </font>
    <br><i>(A ghost in a chair appears behind them)</i>
    <br>Ghost Captain:  Please, help me!
    <i>(They all turn to it)</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: ...!?</font>
    <br>Ghost Captain: <i>(Turns the chair towards them)</i>  He...killed...the crew...Nanny...knights...me...and the newborn princess....<i>(Pauses)</i>  Him....The Black...Monster.
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Walks up to him)</i>  Wh...What!?  This was done by the Black Monster too!? </font>
    <br>Ghost Captain:  <i>(Turns towards Dart)</i>  We couldn't protect...the princess, so we couldn't finish dying.  Please destroy the fear...please send the souls of the knights to rest.  <i>(Looks up)</i>  AAAAARRRRRGGGGGGHHHH!!!  <i>(Disappears)</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Lowers head and shakes fist)</i>  It's impossible to fully die.  <i>(Turns to the others)</i>  He kills people for no reason!</font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  ...</font>
    <br><i>(Dart picks up the key the Captain left behind and leaves)</i>

<p><i>Dart begins to leave the ship and a ghost knight appears</i>
    <br>Ghost Knight:  We won't give you Princess Louvia!  <i>(Lunges at Rose)</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Rose!! </font>
    <br><i>(Ghost Knight tries to attack Rose but fades as he does.  Another Ghost Knight appears behind Rose)</i>
    <br>Ghost Knight:  We'll protect her even if it costs our lives!  <i>(Rose turns to him.  He goes to attack Rose but fades as he does)</i>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  "After counting 108 years, when the Moon that Never Sets glows read, a moon child descends upon the earth, to fill the world with holy bliss."  However, what was actually brought was the child of destruction, the Black Monster.  <i>(Dart and Shana turn to Albert)</i>  We are witnessing a tragedy from the past. </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  It's awful.  Why did it have to do this? </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  The Black Monster!!  How much does he have to kill before he satisfies himself!? </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  Stop it!!  <i>(They all turn to her.  She shakes her head)</i>  Sorry.  What was I thinking?  <i>(Shrugs)</i>  Let's move on.  <i>(Turns to Dart, then Shana)</i>  You want to know, don't you? </font>

<p><i>In newly-opened room, Dart goes for the next door and tries to open it</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  !?  <i>(He turns to the Head of Ghost Knights which appeared)</i></font>
    <br>Head of Ghost Knights:  You, Black Monster.... <i>(Draws sword)</i>
    <br><i>(Ghost Knight A appears and Dart turns to him)</i>
    <br>Ghost Knight A:  How dare you come here, pursuing Princess Louvia.  <i>(Draws sword)</i>
    <br><i>(Dart and Rose try to run away, but Ghost Knight B appears)</i>
    <br>Ghost Knight B:  But, as long as we are here with her, we are not going to give her up.
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  We are not the Black Monster!  We are...!</font>
    <br><i>(Ghost Knight B draws sword)</i>
    <br><i>(Ghost Knight C appears.  Dart and Rose turn to him)</i>
    <br>Ghost Knight C:  How dare you monster, using human words to fool us.  <i>(Draws sword)</i>
    <br><i>(Ghost Knight D appears.  Dart and Rose turn to him)</i>
    <br>Ghost Knight D:  Unforgivable.  Even if it costs my life, I won't give up our Princess Louvia!!!
    <br><i>(Draws sword.  Dart and Rose draw their swords and the battle begins)</i>

<p><i>After battle</i>
    <br>Ghost Knights: <i>(Go to attack Dart)</i>  AHHHHHH!!!
    <br><i>(Dart turns to Head of Ghost Knight)</i>
    <br>Head of Ghost Knight:  <i>(Swings sword)</i>  Princess?  Princess!
    <br><i>(Shana runs out to him)</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Shana!! </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  It's over!  There is no more Black Monster.  Oh please....Please suffer no more. </font>

    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  ...I...!?</font>
    <br>Head of Ghost Knight:  Thank god.  You made it.  Princess Louvia....<i>(Backs off, bows, and fades)</i>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  <i>(Runs up to where the ghost was)</i>  W, Wait!! </font>
    <br><i>(Dart puts his sword away)</i>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  <i>(Covers face with her hands and shakes her head)</i>  Is there still something that I don't know about? </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Walks up to Shana and puts a hand on her shoulder.  The door previously locked opens.  !?  They both turn to it)</i>  The door is open. </font>
    <br><i>In room, there is a cradle.  As Dart approaches it, it begins to rock and the Ghost Nanny appears</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: !? </font>
    <br>Ghost Nanny:  <i>(Floats around)</i>  Princess Louvia, she was still young.  If she wasn't a princess of Mille Seseau, this wouldn't have happened.
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  <i>(Walks up to Ghost Nanny)</i>  Princess of Mille Seseau? </font>
    <br>Ghost Nanny: <i>(Turns to Shana)</i>  Oh my, you are...?  <i>(Goes up to Shana, who backs off)</i> Alive...Oh lord.  It was not in vain.  I have been wandering for 18 years and longing for you.  <i>(Turns away from Shana)</i>  I can now end everything.  I can go to the place where everyone is.  <i>(Disapears)</i>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  Wait!  What kind of relationship do I have with this person!? </font>
    <br><i>The cradle stops rocking, and everyone expect Rose turns to it</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  !?  <i>(The ship begins to shake)</i>  This ship is sinking!? </font>
    <br><i>They leave</i>

<p><i>Meanwhile, on the Queen Fury</i>
    <br>Kayla:  Everything is fixed and under control in the engine room now, sir!!
    <br>Commodore Puler:  Now let's relax and wait for Dart and the others to come back.
    <br><i>The ghosts disappear and the ship begins shaking</i>
    <br>Kayla:  Whoa!?
    <br>Commodore Puler:  Kayla!!  Get ready quick!!
    <br><i>Albert runs to the Queen Fury</i>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  Everyone!!  Hurry up!! </font>

    <br><i>Rose and Dart approach</i>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  Let's go!!  We are the last ones!!</font>
    <br><i>Albert jumps on, and then Rose.  Dart tries to jump on but slips and begins to fall.  Rose leans over and catches his hand.  Albert and Shana run over to the side of the ship</i></font>

    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  Rose!? </font>
    <br><i>The Ghost ship pulls away</i>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  Dart!!  Rose!!! </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  Dart!!! </font>
    <br><i>Dart and Rose fall into the water</i>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  <i>(Turns to Commodore Puler)</i>  Commodore Puler!!  Put out the life raft, quick! </font>

<p><i>Screen goes to black</i>

<p><i>Rose walks into a cave where she is waiting for Dart to wake up.  She kneels down in front of the fire for a moment, then walks over to Dart.  She lifts his head into her lap</i>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  Dart and Zieg, they are so much alike.  Not only are they Dragoons recognized by the Red-Eyed Dragon, but there is something else, something that attracts me....<i>(She looks down into Dart's face)</i>  After 11,000 years of time, I now feel the strength and tenderness of Dart...and even...his frailty.  These tame the insanity of the Dragoon for me. <i>(Pauses)</i>  Zieg....If my hands could grab him, I wouldn't have had this bitterness. </font>

<p><i>Dragon Campaign scene</i>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  I saw Zieg in Dart.  But....Dart is Dart.  He is not Zieg.  <i>(Pauses)</i>  No...he is not Zieg.  <i>(Looks into Dart's face again, then falls asleep)</i></font>

<p><i>The next morning, a dog barks as he finds Dart and Rose in a cave.  A boy approaches</i>
    <br>Pete:  Pooch!  What's wrong!?  <i>(Goes into the cave)</i>  Oh my god!!  There is somebody there!!

<p><i>Pete leads Dart and Rose to his village, then to his house.  Pooch goes up to Dart</i>
    <br>Pete:  Pooch, you like him, don't ya?  I was surprised.  Nobody would think there are people there.
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Turns to Pete)</i>  We are saved thanks to you, Pete.  <i>(Kneels down to Pooch)</i>  We have to thank Pooch too. </font>
    <br>Pete:  By the way.  Are you in love with each other?  Cuz you two are traveling alone.
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Gets up, scratches his head)</i>  Do you think so? </font>
    <br>Pete:  <i>(Turns to his mom)</i>  I think so.  Don't they look it?
    <br>Pete's ma:  Yes.  You make a good couple.
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  Don't be silly. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Nods)</i>  We are just looking for our friends.  Actually, there are seven of us. </font>
    <br>Pete:  <i>(Walks up to Dart)</i>  Okay, but you don't need to be shy.
    <br><i>Dart shakes his head and hands in the air</i>
    <br>Pete's ma:  *Cough* *Cough* *Cough*
    <br><i>(Pete and Dart go up to her)</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Are you sick? </font>
    <br>Pete's ma:  It's nothing.  *Cough*
    <br>Pete:  <i>(Turns to Dart)</i>  Actually, we should have been to the clinic in the neighboring town.
    <br><i>Pooch walks up to Dart.  Rose turns to them</i>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  Neighboring town? </font>
    <br>Pete: <i>(Turns to her)</i>  It's Fueno.  There is a port and they have a boat to Donau.
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  You know what...?  The Queen Fury might have dropped by.  <i>(Dart turns to Rose and they both nod.  Dart turns back to Pete)</i>  But why don't you take your mother to Fueno? </font>
    <br>Pete:  Cuz there is a monster on the way in the Undersea Cavern.  <i>(Turns to his mom)</i>
    <br>Pete's ma:  I know we rarely have guests, but we have to let them go, Pete. <i>(Pauses)</i>  Mr. Dart.  I hop you can meet your friends soon.
    <br>Pete: <i>(Turns to Dart)</i>  I hope so too!  Say hi to everybody, okay!?

<p><i>Dart nods, turns to Rose, and they leave.  As they leave the village, Pete and Pooch run up to them</i>
    <br>Pete:  Dart!! <i>(Puts his hand on his knees)</i>  *Huff.  Huff*
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  What's wrong? </font>
    <br>Pete: <i>(Stands up)</i>  Would you please take us to Fueno!  <i>(Pauses, then lowers his head)</i>  I'm afraid of the monster, but we gotta go before it's too late!
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Walks up to Pete and kneels in front of him)</i>  It's about your mother, isn't it. </font>
    <br>Pete:  <i>(Looks at Dart and nods)</i>  I want her to be in the hospital.
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Stands up and nods)</i>  You got it.  We'll take you there.  </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  I can annihilate the monster for you.  <i>(Pete, Pooch, and Dart all turn to her and back away)</i>  Did I say something wrong?
        <br><i>Dart and Pete both shake their head</i></font>
    <br>Pete:  <i>(Turns to Dart, and he to him)</i>  Thank you!  I'll bring my ma!!
    <br><i>Pete runs back to his house.  Dart turns to Rose</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Quickly shakes his head and looks away)</i>  No, nothing. </font>
    <br><i>Pete and his mom comes back.  She wipes her forehead and bows to Dart</i>

<p><i>In Undersea Cavern, Pete stops Dart and looks at the water</i>
    <br>Pete:  Since the Monster appeared, th water has never ebbed.  But it's okay cuz Fueno is not this way.
    <br><i>Dart nods, and they leave</i>

<p><i>In Fueno</i>
    <br>Pete: <i>(Jumps up)</i>  Here we are at Fueno!!  Thank you!  Dart and Rose!
    <br><i>Pete's ma bows to them</i>

    <br>Pete: <i>(Looks back and forth at Dart and Rose)</i>  But, are you actually in love with each other?  Cuz in that cave, you....
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  <i>(Picks him up and turns him to the side.  Pooch barks and runs over to them)</i>  (You are a good boy and didn't see anything, okay?)</font>
    <br>Pete:  (O...okay.  I didn't see it, maybe.)
    <br><i>Pete and Pooch run back over to his mom</i>
    <br>Pete:  It's nothing!  We are going!  <i>(Pete and Pooch leave.  Pete's ma bows to them and walks over to Pete.  As they are leaving, Pete turns back to Rose and Dart)</i>  Rose!  You gotta confess to him!!
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  <i>(Chases them off)</i>  Kids....  <i>(Dart folds his arms.  Rose walks up to him)</i>  What are you looking at? </font>
    <br><i>Dart waves his hands and they leave</i>

<p><i>At the dock, Kayla is talking to a Crew member</i>
    <br>Kayla:  Well...in that storm....Even for the powerful Dart and Rose.
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: !?  <i>(Dart and Rose walk up to them, and Dart folds his arms)</i></font>

    <br>Kayla:  Thank god!!  Both of you are safe!!
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Nods)</i>  That was nothing. </font>
    <br>Kayla:  Oh!!  Did you see Miss Shana!?  <i>(Dart shakes his head)</i>  Please go to her, hurry!  She hasn't spoken even a word, since you disappeared!
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Runs to the ship, then turns back to Kayla)</i>  Is she on the boat!? </font>
    <br>Kayla:  <i>(Shakes her head)</i>  Everybody is in the city now!
    <br><i>Rose nods, and they both leave.  On their way out, they run into Meru</i>

<p>Dart: <i>(Enters the hotel but no one is there)</i>  Hmm?  She said the hotel.... <i>(Dart and Rose walk in and look around, but Meru is sneaking up to him from behind)</i>  Meru....Where is she?
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Covers his eyes)</i>  Who am I!? </font>

    <br><i>Dart nods, then turns to Albert</i>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  She is in the back room upstairs. </font>
    <br><i>Dart nods and runs up the stairs.  Everyone begins to spread out.  Meru stands guard at the base of the stairs</i>

    <br><i>Dart hugs her back</i>

<p><i>Later, downstairs, Dart tells the group about their journey</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  And this and that....We finally made it to Fueno. </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  Not only that, you two are safe and sound.  It is just a miracle that the seven of us can meet again.  We have to offer our thanks to the Tiberoan God.  </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Turns to Albert)</i>  We ougt to return the favor to the God by taking the Moon Dagger back. </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  We have to catch Lenus then.  <i>(Albert shrugs)</i></font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Jumps off the table she was sitting on)</i>  May I ask you a question please!? </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Stands up)</i>  What's wrong?  Why are you being so formal like that? </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Turns away)</i>  You guys were alone in the cave, weren't you?  <i>(Turns back to Dart and shrugs)</i>  Did you guys put yourselves into...um...a romantic situation? </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Stands up and throws his hands in the air)</i>  Meru!  Don't be silly.  Even though you are trying to learn about love it's too rude! </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Looks down and kicks her foot)</i>  Okay.  <i>(Sits back down on the table)</i></font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:   <i>(Walks up to Dart)</i>  So, Dart.  Did you cuddle with Rose? </font>
    <br>Everyone:  Haschel!!
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Shrugs)</i>  Sorry, sorry.  It slipped out. <i>(Sits back down)</i></font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Turns to Haschel and crosses his arms)</i>  What do you mean "slipped". </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  Don't worry, Shana.  Dar was concerned about you the whole time.  <i>(Dart turns to her)</i>  Anyway, about Lenus....<i>(Dart unfolds his arms and looks away)</i>  We should go out and ask about her in the city.  We may find out something. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Stands up and puts his hands on his hips)</i>  I...I agree. </font>

<p><i>They leave to the Queen Fury</i>
    <br>Commodore Puler:  Dart!!  Rose!!  I was sure that you were alive!!
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Shakes his head and throws his arm aside)</i>  I cannot die that easily, at least not until we get Lenus. </font>
    <br>Commodore Puler:  Lenus!!
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  What's wrong, so all of a sudden? </font>
    <br>Puler: <i>(Crosses his arms)</i>  I got information about her!!  <i>(Unfolds his arms)</i>  It seems that monsters we've never seen before started to infest the area a half year ago.  Moreover, those monsters are spreading out.  <i>(Turns away, takes as step, then turns back to them)</i>  The place is called the Prison Island.  It's a small island surrounded by rocks located in the center of the San Christ islands.  I heard you can go through an Undersea Cavern.
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Folds his arms)</i>  A half year ago....</font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  <i>(Turns to Dart)</i>   It's the same time that Lenus switched with Princess Emille, isn't it? </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Unfolds his arms, turns to her and nods, then turns back to Puler)</i>  We're gonna go check out the Prison Island! </font>
    <br><i>Puler nods, and they leave</i>

<p><i>Later</i>
    <br>Pete:  Hey!  It's you!
    <br><i>Dart turns to him, then to his mother</i>
    <br>Pete's ma:  My doctor says I can go home in a little while.
    <br><i>(Dart nods, then turns to Pete)</i>
    <br>Pete:  When I grow up, I'm gonna be a good doctor!
    <br><i>Dart nods</i>

<p><i>Dart approaches a drunk person and two City Dwellers</i>
    <br>City Dweller A:  It's too sad to hear the story.
    <br>City Dweller B:  The only thing we can do is buy some drinks for him.
    <br>Drippy:  <i>(Turns to Dart while hiccupping)</i>  You, you odn't believe me either!?  I really saw it!  I saw a Dragon on the Prison Island!
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Shakes his head)</i>  Dragon!?  On the Prison Island? </font>
    <br>Drippy:  <i>(Hiccups)</i>  You don't know that!  My ship was smashed by the Sea Dragon rumored to live over the Undersea Cavern!  I gotta have a drink or something!  <i>(Begins to sway and hiccup)</i>  But!  You cannot go there anymore!  There are lots of monsters there!  My house was taken by those monsters!  I gotta have a drink!  <i>(Hiccups, then falls to the ground while still swaying)</i>  It was a half year ago that the monsters showed up.  It's all the mosnter's fault that I'm like this now.  Give my ship and house back. ZZZZZZ.....
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  A half year ago....It is the same time that Lenus joined the gang. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Nods and turns to her)</i>  Okay.  Let's go to the Prison Island. </font>
    <br><i>(Rose nods)</i>
    Drippy:  <i>(Stands up)</i>  And, in the Prison Island?

<p><i>In the Undersea Cavern, the cave shakes as something roars</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  What is that noise!? </font>
<p><i>The monster roars again.  Meru kneels down tightly and begins to shake</i>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  <i>(Points to the other side of the cavern)</i>  It's from over there! </font>
    <br><i>Everyone except Meru looks</i>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  There must be something over there. </font>
    <br><font color="660066">Rose:  <i>(Takes a step towards the water)</i>  It's not just "something".  It's seems that the rumor about the Sea Dragon is true. </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  That is the Dragon's cry. </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  <i>(Turns to her)</i>  I can't blame you for feeling scared. </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Jumps up and turns to Rose)</i>  I...I'm not scared!  A dragon or two is nothing! </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Turns to them and nods)</i>  We have to look for a way to go to the Prison Island. </font>
    <br><i>The Dragon roars again and they leave</i>

<p><i>In Lidiera, Dart speaks with the Mayor</i>
    <br>Mayor of Lidiera:  Sorry!  I'm in the middle of something!  Here we go!  How's this!?
    <br>Villager A:  Darn!!  Not again!
    <br>Mayor of Lidiera:  Well!  I got a good win!  Let's take a break!  And what do you want?
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  We want to go to the Prison Island, but we cannot go because of the flood tide.  We are wondering if there is any other way to go. </font>
    <br><i>They all turn to Dart</i>
    <br>Mayor of Lidiera:  You said the Prison Island!?
    <br>Villager A: Are you serious?
    <br>Villager B:  Do you want to commit suicide or something?
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Nods)</i>  We are serious but we don't want to commit suicide. </font>
    <br>Mayor of Lidiera:  You know it's dangerous to go there, young man!!  But, why!?  Why would you want to throw yourself into danger?

<p><i>Answer to "Danger attracts me"</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Danger attracts me. </font>
    <br>Mayor of Lidiera:  What!?  I cannot let daredevils like you go there!  I didn't close the way because it was fun!  Now go!
    <br><i>Dart scratches his head, turns away, then turns back to the Mayor</i>

<p><i>Answer to "Danger is my middle name"</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Danger is my middle name. </font>
    <br>Mayor of Lidiera:  What!?  I cannot let crazy people like you go there!  I didn't close the way because it was fun!  Get out of my sight!
    <br><i>Dart scratches his head, turns away, then turns back to the Mayor</i>

<p><i>Answer to "We need to see the monster"</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  I need to see the monster. </font>
    <br>Mayor of Lidiera:  You need to "see" the monster!? ......You look serious.  The appearance....You are warriors, arent' you?  I got it.  I'll tell ya.  But it's up to you, whether you can survive there or not!  I closed the route to the Prison Island, after the monster problem arose.
    <br>Villager A: <i>(Turns to the Mayor)</i>  Why didn't you close the whole cave, it's really dangerous.
    <br>Villager B:  <i>(Turns to Villager A)</i>  Then we wouldn't be able to go to Fueno?
    <br>Mayor Of Lidiera:  That's why I closed only the path to the Prison Island.
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  I have a question.  How do you control the tide?  It's puzzling me. </font>
    <br>Mayor of Lidiera:  <i>(Turns to Albert)</i>  Oh!  Don't be so puzzled!  I just closed the gate to the sea when the tide was full!  Then after the tide has ebbed, the water level won't go down inside!
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  Oh...my.  What a simple trick. </font>
    <br>Mayor of Lidiera:  You imagined I could think of something complicated!?  Haa haa haa!!  <i>(Turns to the guy on the bridge)</i>  Hey!!  Open the gimmick gate for'em!!
    <br>Villager:  I got it!!  <i>(Opens the gate to the cave)</i>
    <br>Mayor of Lidiera:  <i>(Turns to Dart)</i>  Go into the cave from the right side of Pete's house.  Turn the Valve and you can open the gate.  Then you can go to the Prison Island!  <i>(Turns back to the villagers)</i>

<p><i>In the cave, Dart walks up to the valve</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Turning this valve should open the gate.  <i>(Turns valve, and the water level goes down)</i>  Now!  We can go to the Prison Island! </font>

<p><i>On the Island of the Jailed Dragon, Lenus is speaking with Lloyd</i>
    <br>Lenus:  <i>(Walks up to him and shows him the Moon Dagger)</i>  Here is the Moon Dagger that you wanted.  <i>(Lloyd slowly takes it and Lenus backs off)</i>  I didn't kill those Humans as you said.  But why did you suddenly start to say such a thing?
    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd:  <i>(Folds his arms)</i>  The blood-smeared road might be the only way to leadu us to the world we desire.  <i>(Turns around and walks a couple steps)</i>  Death gives birth to tears.  And tears give birth to anger.  When anger turns itself into rancor, it opens to war.  <i>(Turns back to Lenus)</i>  It's silly that I have to repeat it, and since once is enough.</font>
    <br>Lenus: <i>(Nods)</i>  Well, I won't stop you if you want to do so, Lloyd.  Anyway!  He's called something like Dart!  <i>(Walks up to him and throws her hand in the air)</i>  Aren't they the ones coming after you, Lloyd!?
    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd:  <i>(Walks up to Lenus and folds his arms)</i>  It's all in my plan.</font>
    <br>Lenus:  <i>(Walks up to him)</i>  Hmm.  "Plan" huh?  Now, let me tell you my plan.  <i>(Leans up to him)</i>  My plan is to get a hot prize from you.  <i>(There is some noise, and both Lenus and Lloyd turn towards it)</i>  Tut!  Hey, your disturbing my moment here!!  You're gonna pay for this!!
    <br><i>Dart, Rose, Meru, and Albert run into the scene</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Draws his sword)</i>  Why...why is Lloyd here!?  <i>(Pauses)</i>  Is this all part of your plot!? </font>
    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd:  My will is with Emperor Diaz.  Namely, everything was planned by the god.</font>
    <br><i>Dart holds up his weapon</i>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  You are still talking about that crap! </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  You killed Lavitz, let us settle this score now!! </font>
    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd:  <i>(Turns and walks away, then turns back to them)</i>  I have the calling to reform the world.  I have no time to pay attention to little things, like Lavitz.</font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Lloyd!!  I cannot stand it anymore!! </font>
    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd:  <i>(Jumps on a rock)</i> I am the one who torched your home to the ground.  I am the one who deprived your friend of his life.  And I hold the Moon Gem and the Moon Dagger in my hands!  <i>(Turns around)</i>  You abhor me, don't you? <i>(Jumps away in a blinding light as Dart and the others run for him)</i>  I am heading to Mille Seseau.  Pursue me, if you can survive!</font>
    <br><i>Light fades</i>
    <br>Lenus:  <i>(Points at Dart and the others)</i>  Easy easy!  Wait a minute!  Don't be so hasty!  <i>(Dart shrugs, as does Lenus)</i>  It was nice of him giving you an "invitation".  But you gotta decline it.  <i>(Puts her hands on her hips and transforms into the Blue Sea Dragoon)</i>  Because you will die now in here!!
    <br><i>Regole roars, and the battle begins</i>

<p><i>After battle, Dart goes in for the final blow</i>
    <br>Lenus: <i>(Stumbles slightly)</i>  Lloyd, <i>(Shana, Meru, and Dart watch)</i> my life <i>(Holds out her weapons.  Shana gasps as the weapons begin to glow)</i>  is for you!!  <i>(Lenus throws her weapons, then falls to the ground</i>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  Dart!  <i>(Jumps and pushes Dart out of the way as one of the weapons zooms by them)</i></font>
    <br><i>Dart takes his sword and knocks the other weapon out of their path</i>
    <br><i>Meru looks down at Lenus</i>
    <br>Lenus:  Lloyd....she closes her eyes
    <br><i>Shana, Meru, and Dart all look on sadly as Lenus's Dragoon Spirit leaves her body and goes up into the sky</i>
    <br><i>Albert, Dart, Shana, and Rose watch as the Blue Sea Dragoon Spirit falls in front of Meru and begins to glow.  Meru falls to the ground</i></font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  This....</font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  It's Meru's Dragoon Spirit. </font>
    <br><i>Shana nods</i>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  Oh, I am surprised that Meru was recognized. </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Gets up and turns to Rose)</i> Does that mean this Dragoon Spirit chose me?  <i>(Dart nods as she turns to him)</i>  It means....Am I one of the Dragoons?  <i>(Dart nods again.  Meru spins around and begins jumping and dancing around the cave while Shana is watching)</i>  I'm a Dragoon too! </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  <i>(Dart and Albert turn to her)</i> "Dragoon Spirits attract each other, and Dragoons gather as the Dragon Spirit desires....As Soa's fate leads...."</font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Puts his hands on his hips)</i> Are we drawn to each other like that?  Is that what you are saying? </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: <i>(Turns away)</i>  It's just folklore.  <i>(Leaves)</i>  You are going to pursue Lloyd aren't you? </font>
    <br><i>Dart nods and begins to leave</i>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  <i>(Shrugs)</i>  Unfortuantely, we have to go meet King Zior to tell him we couldn't bring the Moon Dagger back.  <i>(Dart nods and Albert leaves)</i></font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Turns to Shana)</i>  Aren't you hurt? </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: <i>(Bows)</i>  No, thanks to you, Dart.  <i>(They walk up to each other and leave together)</i></font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Suddenly stops dancing and turns to the exit)</i>  Hey guys!!  Don't you ignore me like that!!  Heeey wait for me!!  <i>(Begins to leave, but stops and looks up at the sky)</i></font>

<p><i>Back in Fueno</i>
    <br><i>Dart walks up to Puler, and Puler to him</i>
    <br>Puler:  Dart!  I've heard about you!  You successfully defeated the monster on the Prison Island and the female bandit!  <i>(Dart nods)</i>  What's wrong?  You have a long face.  We are ready to go back to Fletz in triumph.
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Lowers his head)</i> We couldn't get the Moon Dagger back. </font>
    <br>Puler:  <i>(Walks away and folds his arms)</i>  I like the ocean.  <i>(Unfolds his arms and walks back to Dart)</i>  Let yourself flow in the waves and winds.  The problems of this world become not a problem at all.  <i>(Walks past Dart)</i>  Here is an idea, Dart.  Why don't you come with me on the ocean?  <i>(Turns to him)</i> Dart, you would make a good sailor, nor even a great man of the sea!
    <br><i>(Dart folds his arms)</i>

<p><i>Answer to "A man of the sea, not bad."</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  A man of the sea, not bad.  </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  <i>(Dart turns to her)</i>  What are you talking about!  We have to pursue Lloyd now! </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Scratches his head)</i>  Yeah.  We have something we have to take care of.  <i>(Turns back to Puler)</i></font>
    <br>Puler:  I understand, but it's a shame.  However, I'm moved that you considered being a man of the sea.  It's small, but it's my farewell gift to you!  Take this!  <i>(Gives Dart 100G. Begins to board the ship and turns to Dart)</i>  Dart, as soon as you are ready, just come aboard.  <i>(Runs off)</i>  Meet you on the boat!  Be ready for departure!!

<p><i>Answer to "I can't."</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  I can't.  I still have something to take care of. </font>
    <br>Puler:  I understand.  It's a shame, though.  <i>(Begins to board the ship and turns to Dart)</i>  Dart, as soon as you are ready, just come aboard.  <i>(Runs off)</i>  Meet you on the boat!  Be ready for departure!!
    <br>Kayla: <i>(Runs into the ship)</i>   Casting off!  Getting ready to cast off!!  <i>(Dart enters the ship)</i>

<p><i>Back in Fletz, as Dart and Albert approach the city square</i>
    <br>Villagers:  Princess Emille is here!!  <i>(People begin running out of their houses)</i>
    <font color="#006633">Albert:  <i>(Turns to Dart)</i>  Let's go!  <i>(They leave)</i></font>
    <br>Villagers:  <i>(Watch as Princess Emille comes down the stairs)</i>  Her graceful steps....Her dainty movement of the hands....Her gracious eyes....She must be....She is our Princess Emille!!  Princess Emille is back!!
    <br>Princess Emille:  <i>(Enters the square as she turns to the people)</i>  I have returned after a half year of sleep.  <i>(Everyone claps)</i>  My father, King Zior wouldn't say it, but I heard that the evildoings of the sinner who feigned to be me has hamred our people in Tiberoa.  <i>(Shakes her head and folds her arms)</i>  I can say it is my fault.  Because people were wounded by trusting someone they thought was me.  <i>(Nods)</i>  I am determined to make atonements for this, even if it takes forever.
    <br>Villagers:  <i>(Begin clapping)</i>  It wasn't your fault Your Majesty!!  <i>(Emille turns to them)</i>  Please do not blame yourself, Your Highness!!  Your returning only makes us happy!!
    <br>Emille:  <i>(Looks around)</i>  I owe you a debt of gratitude.  I love this country.  I love you people.  Let us make this country continue to be a wonderful country!
    <br><i>Crowd hushes as the Pregnant Mother approaches Princess Emille</i>
    <br>Pregnant Mother:  I have a favor to ask you, Princess Emille.  <i>(She nods)</i> May I ask you to name my baby, my soon-to-be-born baby, Your Highness?
    <br>Emille: <i>(Nods)</i>  It would be my pleasure.  <i>(Turns away a moment, then turns back to the Pregnant Mother)</i>  How about Eyie for a girl and Al for a boy?  They have the sound of great energy and strength.
    <br>Pregnant Mother:  They are beautiful names!!  I thank you very much Your Highness!!
    <br><i>Crowd cheers as the Pregnant Mother leaves</i>
    <br>Villagers:  God bless Princess Emille!!  God Bless Tiberoa Kingdom!!  All the best for the kingdom and us!!
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  Oh Princess Emille....How beautiful she is....</font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Albert? </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  Just like I imagined...Oh, thank you lord for leading me to the country of Princess Emille....</font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Shakes his head)</i>  Is something wrong?</font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  <i>(Pauses, then quickly turns to Dart)</i>  Oh....Oh.  <i>(Nods)</i>  Oh, no?  Where is Princess Emille? </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Shrugs, then walks up to the guard)</i>  You can meet her again in the castle. </font>
    <br><i>Albert nods</i>

<p><i>In castle, two Tiberoan Knights approach Dart</i>
    <br>Tiberoan Knight:  We have been waiting for you, sir!!  Please proceed to the Chamber of the Sun!!
    <br><i>In the Chamber of the Sun, Dart, Albert, Shana, and Meru kneel as King Zior, Emille, and Lisa stand up</i>
    <br>King Zior:  Heroes!  Forget about formality!  You are the special guests of Tiberoa!  <i>(They stand)</i>  Welcome back!
    <br>Emille:  <i>(Takes a step forward and folds her hands)</i>  I'm glad you are safe and sound.
    <br>Lisa: <i>(Turns to Emille)</i>  My sister is now acting as if nothing happened, but until you came back, King Albert, she had lost her appetite completely.
    <br>King Zior:  <i>(Emille unfolds her hands and she and Lisa turn to him)</i>  It's not only Emille.  <i>(Nods)</i>  We were longing for all of you to come back.  <i>(Walks up to them and shakes his head)</i>  Well done.
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Lowers his head and shakes it)</i>  But...The Moon Dagger is still in their hands...</font>
    <br>King Zior:  <i>(Throws hands in the air)</i>  Stop it!  <i>(Walks a little to the right)</i> You people brought justice upon the evil bandits!! <i>(Walks a little to the left)</i>  You defeated the Sea Dragon that infested Illisa Bay!!  <i>(Walks towards them a little)</i> It was you, young people, who brought peace and happiness to Tiberoa and brought smiles back to our people!!
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  However, the Moon Dagger has to be passed on to Princess Emille...</font>
    <br>King Zior:  <i>(Shakes his head and shrugs)</i>  The Moon Dagger is a mere royal tradition.  <i>(Looks to the sea)</i>  Tradition alone doesn't put smiles on our people's faces.  That is all the Moon Dagger can be.  <i>(Turns back to them and nods)</i>  King <br><font color="#006633">Albert.  We are satisfied with the way things turned out.
        <br>Emille: <i>(Turns to them and folds her hands and nods)</i>  Instead of the Moon Dagger, we found something else to hand down.  That is...the heroic story of you.  </font><i>(Unfolds hands)</i>
    <br>Lisa: <i>(Walks towards them and nods)</i>  It will be passed down through the ages from person to person.  "The seven stars arose from the East to save the country of the king who lives in the Chamber of the Sun."...
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Nods)</i>  It was my pleasure, Your Majesty. </font>
    <br>King Zior:  <i>(Walks back up the stairs and turns to them and nods)</i> That's enough for formality!  <i>(Throws arms in the air)</i>  We are having a banquet for you!  Please enjoy yourself!!
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Runs up to King Zior and throws out her arms)</i>  Is a "Banquet" a party?!! </font>
    <br>King Zior:  <i>(Shrugs)</i>  Plainly speaking yes, it is!!
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Jumps up and down and spins)</i>  Cool!!  It's a party!!  A party for us!!  <i>(Leaves)</i></font>
    <br><i>Albert and Dart shake their heads</i>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  Oh Meru!  Behave and be quiet! </font>
    <br>King Zior:  Haa Haa Haa!!  She is cheerful and excited!!

<p><i>Outside the Sun Chamber</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  It seems we can relax for the first time in a long time, tonight. </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: <i>(Nods)</i>  I think so too...We have to leave here tomorrow.  It is a good chance to relax. </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  <i>(Dart turns to her)</i>  Mille Seseau...The country where Dart was born...We'll be busy again...<i>(Dart nods)</i></font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Walks away a bit)</i>  I'll be walking around till the party starts!  </font>
    <br><i>Leaves, and Kongol and Haschel leave too</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Hey...Where are you going!? </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  I have an errand to do. </font>
    <br><i>Rose leaves</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Are you going too, Rose? </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  <i>(Turns to Dart, and he to him)</i>  Let me go too.  <i>(Begins to leave, then turns back to Dart)</i>  You have to appreciate what everyone did. </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  <i>(Walks up to Dart as he turns to her)</i>  Why don't we go out too? </font>
    <br><i>Dart nods</i>

<p><i>Outside on the balcony, Dart is sitting on a bench and Shana is looking out at the city</i>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  I love you, Dart.  <i>(Pauses)</i> Since I was little...<i>(Looks up to the sky)</i>  It never changed, even when you went on your journey, Dart.  <i>(Looks down and shakes her head)</i>  Actually, I started to love you even more...<i>(Pauses)</i>  Becauswe while you were gone, I was thinking about you every single day</font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Stands up)</i> Shana...</font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: <i>(Turns to him)</i>  So, I don't mind being your baby sister.  Because I can be with you everyday...That's just how I think. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Shakes his head and shrugs)</i>  I...I...don't think of you as a baby sister, Shana.  <i>(Walks towards her)</i> I...</font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  Let's continue this after our journey is over...all right? </font>
    <br><i>They get closer and are about to kiss when Fester appears and runs up to Dart.  Dart and Shana quickly turn away from each other</i>
    <br>Fester:  Dart!  Welcome back!  <i>(Dart turns to Fester as Fester shakes his head)</i>  What's wrong?  You have such a sour face.
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Shakes his head)</i>  You, you think so? </font>
    <br>Fester:  <i>(Shrugs, and Shana turns to him)</i>  Anyway!  You are most famous in the city!  <i>(Turns away)</i>  The hero who defeated the dragon that descended down on Tiberoa!
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Scratches his head as Fester turns to him)</i>  If you say so...It still doesn't feel like it's real. </font>
    <br>Fester:  <i>(Shrugs)</i>  It's your modest attitude!  You are our times latest hero!
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Shrugs)</i>  Um...</font>
    <br>Fester:  <i>(Shrugs)</i>  By the ay, the party is starting!  Get rid of your sour face.  And be happy!  See you later.
    <br><i>Fester leaves.  Dart turns to Shana, shrugs, and they get closer to kiss when Libria enters.  Shana and Dart quickly turn away from each other</i>
    <br>Libria:  Oh!?  Mr. Dart!  Miss Shana!  Why are you here!?
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Turns to her)</i>  We are waiting for the party to start...</font>
    <br>Libria:  It's starting soon!  <i>(Turns to leave)</i>  Please get everyone or I cannot prepare the dresses!  <i>(Turns back to Dart and Shana)</i>   I'll see you later!  <i>(Turns and leaves)</i>
    <br><i>Dart turns to Shana and shrugs</i>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  <i>(Begins to leave)</i>  I am going to look for everybody.  <i>(Leaves)</i></font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Begins to go after her and waves his hands)</i>  Wait!  <i>(Leaves)</i></font>

<p><i>As Dart passes by the kitchen</i>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  Just a peek is fine!  I wanna see the party food! </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  We are not going to eat now.  We just want to sample the food...</font>
    <br>Maid:  That is eating!  Come on!  Please get out!  You are delaying the preparation! <i>(Throws Haschel and Meru out of the kitchen and turns to Dart)</i>  Mr. Dart!  Please stop them!
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Shrugs)</i>  Wars never choose their time.  You have to eat whenever you can.  That is a basic understanding for a warrior! </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(She and Haschel turn to Dart)</i>  You wanna eat too, don't ya Dart? </font>

<p><i>Answer to "Me too!"</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Me too! </font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  <i>(Turns to Dart and he to her)</i>  Stop it!  You are not a kid anymore!  <i>(Dart scratches his head.  Shana turns to Haschel)</i>  You too Haschel!  The party is starting soon.  Behanve yourself! </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Throws her hands in the air)</i>  Is that true? </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Shrugs)</i>  Why didn't you say so! </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Shrugs)</i>  Y, Yes!  I'm here to tell you that! </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Jumps)</i>  C'mon.  Let's go! </font>
    <br><i>(They leave)</i>

<p><i>Answer to "The party is starting soon."</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Throws out his arm)</i>  The party is starting soon.  You can eat as much as you want then, right? </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Shrugs)</i>  Is that true? </font>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Shrugs)</i>  Why didn't you say so! </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Shrugs)</i>  I'm there to tell you that. </font>

<p><i>In the guest room, Rose is leaning against a wall</i>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  [I am...a hero...He would laugh at me...] *Chuckle*...[...!?  I...laughed now......I did laugh...]  <i>(Shakes her head and stands up.  She takes off her choker and holds it out as it sparkles)</i>  [Since I have started to wear this choker...]  <i>(Puts it back on and crosses her arms as she leans up against the wall again)</i>  [I have not laughed...for years...]  *Chuckle*...[It was worth the wait...]</font>

    <br><i>Dart nods, and they leave</i>

<p><i>In Training Room, Kongol is swinging his axe</i>
    <br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol:  Kongol has friends.  Friends of different species.  Not bad. </font>
    <br><i>Dart walks up to him from behind.  Kongol turns around and brings the axe close to Dart's face</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Leans back)</i>  Whoa!! </font>
    <br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol:  <i>(Lowers axe and throws out his arm)</i>  Don't do that. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Shakes his head)</i>  That's what I should say! </font>
    <br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol: <i>(Turns away)</i>  Did you hear Kongol speaking? </font>

<p><i>Albert is up in Emille's room, both of them sitting on a small couch</i>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  do you know about the Legend of the Mermaid? </font>
    <br>Emille: <i>(Shakes her head)</i>  No....Please tell me about it.
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: <i>(Stands up and walks out a away)</i>  The king of some country is gazing out over the waves of the sea and thinking, his life is hollow, just like the vanishing bubbles.  Everything looked like that because the king didn't know true love.  <i>(Nods and turns to Emille)</i>  Under the waves, a mermaid was thinking the same things while gazing at the clouds in the sky. </font>
    <br>Emille:  <i>(Shakes her head)</i>  Oh my....And what happened to the two of them?
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  <i>(Puts his hand to his chin)</i>  Would you like to know?  <i>(Emille nods, and Albert turns away)</i>  This is a secret story handed down only within the Serdio royal family, so...I cannot tell you anymore.  Oh...I'm sorry I cannot go on. </font>
    <br>Emille:  <i>(Shakes her head as Albert turns to her)</i>  Oh!  You are teasing me!  <i>(Stands up and walks over to him)</i>  *Chuckle*...But I am having a fabulous time.  I didn't notice the passing of time when I'm talking to you.
    <br><i>They nod, and Dart knocks and enters the room.  They both turn to him</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  I knew it, you are here....</font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  <i>(Walks up to Dart)</i>  Is something wrong? </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Nods)</i>  The party is starting soon.  So I am calling everybody down. </font>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  <i>(Shakes his head and shrugs)</i>  It's already that time.  <i>(Turns to Emille)</i>  Unfortunately, I have to leave you. </font>
    <br>Emille:  <i>(Shakes her head and folds her hands)</i>  When can we meet again?
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  <i>(Turns and walks away a little, then looks to the ceiling)</i>  When the stars fill the sky....</font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Shrugs)</i>  You can simply say "tonight". </font>
    <br>Emille:  <i>(Unfolds her hands and walks up to Albert as he turns to her)</i>  At the party....
    <br><i>Albert nods and joins Dart</i>

<p><br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Nods)</i>  That's everybody.  <i>(Folds his arms)</i>  By the way, She was saying something about dresses, but where should we go...?  We have to ask Libria about it...</font>

<p><i>In dressing room, Libria is waiting</i>
    <br>Lady's maid Libria:  <i>(Walks up to Dart, Shana, Meru, and Rose)</i>  It seems everyone is here.  <i>(Walks up to the dressing room and turns back to them)</i>  Miss Shana, Miss Rose, and Miss Meru, please come this way...You have to change into the dresses.
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  <i>(Shakes her head)</i>  Dresses?  You are talking about us? </font>
    <br>Lady's maid Libria:  Yes I am.  Princess Emille and Princess Lisa insist.
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Turns to Shana, and her to him)</i>  Good for you. </font>
    <br><i>Shana nods</i>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Everyone turns to her as she throws her hands in the air)</i>  No thanks. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Meru turns to him)</i>  It's not like you. </font>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru:  <i>(Spins)</i>  Cuz I'm a dancer.  I can't dance well in those dresses. </font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose:  <i>(Everyone turns to her)</i>  No thanks for me either.  I feel naked without my sword. </font>
    <br><i>Dart shrugs</i>
    <br>Lady's maid Libria:  <i>(Everyone turns to her)</i>  Please wait in the living room.  I will ocme and take you there later.

<p><i>Dart nods, and Shana gets her dress prepared</i>

<p><i>In the guest room, the men are waiting.  Dar folds his arms.  Lady's maid Libria enters</i>
    <br>Lady's maid Libria:  Everything is ready.  Please proceed to the Chamber of the Sun.

    <br>King Zior:  <i>(Stands up from his throne)</i>  This is a banquet to honor the seven heroes who saved Tiberoa!!  <i>(Nods and throws his arms in the air)</i>  Please enjoy yourselves to the utmost!!

<p><i>At the party, Dart walks up to Haschel when two women call out to him</i>
    <br>Women:  Mr. Dart!  Wait for us!
    <br><i>They run up to him</i>
    <br>Woman in red dress:  You must be Mr. Dart!  I am dying to hear your story...
    <br>Woman in blue dress:  <i>(Turns to the other woman)</i>  Oh, excuse me, but monopolizing him is not fair.  <i>(Turns back to Dart)</i>  Please let me hear your story too.
    <br>Woman in red dress:  <i>(Walks up to Dart as he backs off)</i>  I would like to know more about you.
    <br>Woman in blue dress:  <i>(Walks up to them and turns to the other woman)</i>  Oh my!  Don't be so fresh with him!  <i>(Turns to Dart as he waves his hands defensively)</i>  I talked to him first!
    <br><i>They all begin talking when Haschel walks up to them.  The women turn to him)</i>
    <br>Woman in blue dress:  Oh...You must be Mr. Haschel...
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel:  <i>(Turns to Dart)</i>  I'll take care of things here.  Why don't you go and enjoy yourself with Shana.  <i>(Turns back to the women)</i> At least tonight, you have to make good use of the time the two of you are together. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Nods)</i>  Thank you. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Shakes his head)</i>  Do...?  I didn't do anything. </font>
    <br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol:  <i>(Shakes his head)</i>  No Shana here. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  No!? </font>
    <br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol:  <i>(Looks around)</i>  Kongol tall.  Kongol doesn't see from here. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Shakes his head)</i>  Where is she...?</font>
    <br><i>Kongol turns around</i>

    <br><i>Albert is speaking with Princess Emille</i>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  I have to go to Mille Seseau with Dart.</font>
    <br>Emille:  <i>(Shakes her head)</i>  I'll wait for you...I'll wait for you forever.
    <br>King Zior:  <i>(Stands up and turns to Emille)</i>  Emille!  Well said!  The future of Serdio and Tiberoa is shining like the sun!
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  <i>(Shakes his head)</i>  I believe love is the only entity that never changes over time. </font>
    <br>Emille:  <i>(Shakes her head)</i>  And distance makes the love grow deeper.
    <br>King Zior:  <i>(Shakes his head and turns to Lisa)</i>  I cannot watch this anymore!  <i>(Turns to Dart and walks up to him)</i>  What's wrong...you have a long face?
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert:  <i>(Turns to Dart and Dart to him)</i>  ...If you are looking for Shana, she is not here. </font>
    <br><i>Dart nods and leaves</i>
    <br><i>At the balcony</i>
    <br>Libria:  Mr. Dart!  <i>(She walks up to him)</i> Miss Rose needs you.  <i>(Begins to leave and then turns back to him)</i>  This way...<i>(Walks outside)</i>
    <br><i>Dart follows and walks up to Rose, who is leaning against the railing</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  Rose...?</font>
    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: <i>(Shakes her head)</i>  Dart...Why are you procrastinating like that?  Do you want her to catch a cold or something?  Making her wait all night like that?  <i>(Stands up and looks over at Shana)</i>  She's over there. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Turns to Shana and walks up to her.  She turns around and walks over to him)</i>  You look beautiful...</font>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  <i>(Tries to curtsey)</i>  Thank you.  <i>(Looks at her dress)</i>  But...it's all thanks to this dress. </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Shakes his head)</i>  That's not true.  </font><i>(Nods)</i>
    <br><i>They both walk over to the balcony and watch as a star falls from the sky</i>
    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana:  Look!  A falling star!  <i>(Lowers her head)</i>  I wonder if my wish will come true? </font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  <i>(Looks out into the ocean)</i>  It will.  <i>(They turn to each other)</i>  Because...I wished the same thing...</font>
    <br><i>They kiss</i>
