<p><h1>The Legend of Dragoon Script - Chapter Four</h1>

<br><font color="#003399">Meru: I’m totally beaten!</font>

<br><font color="#006633">Albert: We came all this way and we cannot go back. </font>

<br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Yes we did. </font>

<br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol: No need to return. The city of Winglies, Rose said, is just over there. </font>

<br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: What was it called, Ulara…? I hope we can find out what we should do there. </font>

<br><font color="#003399">Meru: I hope so too. </font>

<br><font color="#990000">Dart: Who could imagine there is such a place under the ground of the desert? </font>

<br><font color="#006633">Albert: It must be a cavity created when the water dried up. The world is going on without knowing anything. Without knowing until the end…. I wonder if this little world has experienced an end like that. </font>

<br><font color="#990000">Dart: It is not determined yet that our world will end. </font>

<br><font color="#006633">Albert: That’s true. We are still here. </font>

<p><i>Later</i>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Water! </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: It’s refreshing! </font>

    <br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol: Here no monster. We can rest now. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: What will the Winglies in Ulara know? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: They should know the way we, or at least “I”, should take. So, there is no need for you to come. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Are you still saying that? Don’t you understand it is no longer a problem for you alone!? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: You just found it out a couple of days ago and now you think you can judge me? It is not as easy as pursuing one Wingly. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: You, you say it was “easy”!? Don’t be so conceited! </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Stop it! It won’t lead us anywhere. Rose, nobody can understand the weight of fate you have carried. But we can at least lighten the burden for you. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: That’s why…. We are going with you. If you have the strength to argue, we can go on. There is no other way, is there? </font>

<p><i>Later, at the end of the Death Frontier</i>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Even if an adventurer is lucky enough to make it through the Death Frontier, nobody can proceed from here. Time was stopped for me 11,000 years ago with the spell of this Choker. And, this is the only way to see Ulara, the Spring Breath Town. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: But, where is it? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: The only thing here is an endless desert. </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: No, it’s not, Haschel, I sense it. I sense people’s feelings over there! </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: We can fly over there with this. <i>(Reveals Ulara)</i> Are you afraid? </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I think you are. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Maybe. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: We are standing by you. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: I know. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Let’s go. </font>

<p><i>In Ulara</i>

    <br>Caron: Welcome to Ulara, the Spring Breath Town. I am the guard of the teleporting device, Caron. I’m a good friend of Rose’s.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Long time no see. </font>

    <br>Caron: “Long time”? Rose, you are starting to regain a sense of time, aren’t you? No, not only that. You have recovered a lot of other things too.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Are you the person who stopped time for Rose? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: No, it was Charle Frahma. She is the person we have to meet now. </font>

    <br>Caron: Rose has been carrying the fate of the world all alone while shedding tears of blood. Can you go with Rose?

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Caron, stop it. I don’t need to force them. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I have already settled things with the Black Monster. The only thing left is that I have to complete this journey with my companions. </font>

    <br>Caron: If you understand that, I have nothing to say.

<p><i>Later, by the rose bed</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Roses. I think Shana would be happy to see them. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: It makes me relieved. I didn’t know you liked flowers, Miranda. I guess there is some woman in you. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Don’t misread me. Roses make me puke. They are just flashy. They don’t have any kindness in them. Do you know why roses have thorns? It is to bring out their own red using the blood of the people they hurt. They’ll do anything for their own happiness. Let’s move on. I don’t need to be here. </font>

<p><i>Later</i>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Miata, where is Charle? </font>

    <br>Miata: You are wondering because she normally would be taking care of these babies, right? Charle is preparing herself. Because, well, the things we didn’t tell you about, right? Zieg told you them, so….

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: It must be about the Moon Signet. Tell me what you know. </font>

    <br>Miata: The Signet is the… Signet Sphere. The Signet Sphere is a sealing device that was created to be the last barrier, just in case the Moon Child reached the Moon That Never Sets.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Even my mistake was in your plan. You are really scary people. </font>

    <br>Miata: Even more scary is Zieg. He is trying to destroy the Signet Sphere. Using the Divine Moon Objects.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Wait a minute. You made the Signet Sphere just because you were afraid of the birth of the God of Destruction. And why did you make tools that can destroy the Signet? </font>

    <br>Miata: Ask Charle. It was decided between the siblings.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: I will. </font>

<p><i>Later, at Charle’s house</i>

    <br>Charle: Oh Rosie darling! I have been waiting for you!

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: I don’t need your greetings. You know what I want to ask you. </font>

    <br>Charle: Oh, you are scary. But before that, can you introduce me to the son of dear Zieggy?

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: This is Dart. </font>

    <br>Charle: Doesn’t he look just like our Zieggy? But Rosie honey, it’s complicated. You have to fight with the son of someone who used to be your significant other. And furthermore, the enemy is the significant other.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Do you want me to give you a knuckle sandwich? </font>

    <br>Charle: Sorry honey. But I’m really concerned. So I’m intentionally making it happy and delightful so that you won’t be depressed, Rosie sweetheart.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: You have never changed. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Charle. If you know, please tell us. Where should we head to? </font>

    <br>Charle: Really, you have the same eyes as Zieggy…. I know. I have been waiting for you in order to tell you everything. Now, what would you like me to tell you?

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: About the Signet Sphere. </font>

    <br>Charle: Zieggy is trying to break the Signet of the Moon That Never Sets with the magic power of the Divine Moon Objects. That Signet is the Signet Sphere. I am sorry that I didn’t tell you about this.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: I have to apologize. I missed the Moon Child, Shana. </font>

    <br>Charle: But you still have time. The Signet of the Moon That Never Sets is not broken yet.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Where are the remaining Signets? </font>

    <br>Charle: In the past, they were placed in five cities. But there are only three left.

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: That’s why they needed the same number of Divine Moon Objects. </font>

    Dart: What happened to the other two? </font>

    <br>Charle: One was destroyed in the Royal Capital Kadessa during the Dragon Campaign. And the other was lost when the Divine Dragon assaulted the Crystal Palace.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Does this mean, without the Divine Moon Objects, the Signet Sphere can be destroyed? </font>

    <br>Charle: The Divine Moon Objects are just tools that conceal vast amounts of magic power, that’s all. So in order to destroy the Signet Sphere, having the same amount of magic power as the Divine Moon Objects is sufficient.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: My dad knew about this and made Lloyd collect them. </font>

    <br>Charle: It doesn’t seem like him, and it’s so indirect. Plus, something is strange. I wonder how Zieggy knows about the Signet Sphere?

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Not only that. He knew that Shana is the Moon Child. </font>


    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: About the Moon That Never Sets.</font>

    <br>Charle: It’s the 108th fruit that the Divine Tree dropped. It was conceived with the God of Destruction that ends the world. That’s why we separated it into its soul and flesh and sealed them away. My baby brother Melbu sealed the soul which was the source of magic power in the Crystal Sphere, but um… when he fought with Zieggy, it was broken. Then the soul escaped from the Crystal Sphere and started to transmigrate into a human body. Since then it has been called the Moon Child. What is left is the Moon That Never Sets. When the Moon Child goes back to the Moon That Never Sets, The Virage Embryo, the God of Destruction will be born. So, we needed our Rosie to take on an important task. Please understand her….

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: About my father.</font>

    <br>Charle: You are concerned, aren’t you?

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Why does he have to destroy the world? </font>

    <br>Charle: Sorry, but that is the one thing that I don’t understand.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: But he was unmistakably Zieg. </font>

    <br>Charle: Zieggy was the fiancée of Rosie. They crossed both swords and love. Just looking at them made me feel embarrassed.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Stop right there. I want to talk alone with Zieg about our memories. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I agree. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Why did you make the Divine Moon Objects that can break the Signet Sphere?)</font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: That’s right. If you were not planning to allow the Virage Embryo to be born, you wouldn’t need them. </font>

    <br>Charle: I didn’t want to, but my baby brother Melbu insisted.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: That is not an explanation, Charle. </font>

    <br>Charle: Oh, you are so uptight. But, okay, I’ll explain it to you. I told you that we sealed the Virage Embryo in the Crystal Sphere, right? It is in order to draw lots of magical power and rule over other creatures. I… wanted to make him stop being a dictator. Because even though we have different appearances or capabilities, we are the same. We should be able to live together on good terms. That’s why I created the Signet Sphere in order to weaken the magic power of the Crystal Sphere. Rose, without telling you that. The five Signets that protect the Moon That Never Sets restrained the magic power that flows from there. My operation was a big success! I thought.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: But Melbu found out about it and created the Divine Moon Objects. </font>

    <br>Charle: I guess he was prepared so that he could destroy the Signets anytime he wanted to.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Hmm. I get it. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Where are the rest of the Signets?</font>

    <br>Charle: That’s right. That is the most important information for you, isn’t it? Because Zieggy has the Divine Moon Objects and he can break the Signets anytime. Listen carefully. The rest of the three Signet Spheres are located in the ancient cities. The names of the cities are: the Magical City Aglis, Law City Zenebatos, and Death City Mayfil.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Those cities are still alive? </font>

    <br>Charle: It’s surprising, isn’t it? Of course, they were badly damaged during the war.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: How do we get there? </font>

    <br>Charle: Go to Rogue. Then your way will be opened.

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: You said Rouge!? It’s my hometown! </font>

    <br>Charle: See, it is already open, isn’t it? Well. It’ll be night soon. Why don’t you go look around until tomorrow morning.


<p><i>Later</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: [Now our way is opened. Shana, I’ll be there soon.] <i>Looks to Rose</i>Rose….</font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: You really forgive….</font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Don’t say anything. It’s, already in the past. </font>

<p><i>Flashback to the Death Frontier.  Dart and Rose are swordfighting.  Dart attacks and Rose drops her sword.</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Take your sword. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: You have become strong. You can take care of yourself. Kill me. </font>

    <br><i>Dart turns away</i>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Why? </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: The Black Monster is dead now. We only have…. A companion who is on the same road. </font>


<p><i>Back to Ulara</i>
    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: I miss the time when you were chased by Feyrbrand in the forest. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Me too. And… I didn’t know anything back then. The world is so frail. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: The world is created so that it can perish at any time. The creator Soa can recreate one anytime. But, the people living there can accept it, believing it is “fate” or struggle against it. I struggled in order to protect this world that was taken back by friends who gave up their lives. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I told you. You are no longer alone, Rose. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Dart….</font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Let’s go see everybody. This is just the beginning. </font>

<p><i>Meanwhile, at the Ulara Bar</i>
    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: It’s not true. The reason why I hate roses is because I see my mother in roses. My mother never looked at me directly. It was as if she was hiding something from me. And she beat me up. I didn’t know what was going on and why she was doing it to me, but I remember at least one thing. There were always roses on the shelf behind my mother. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Why did your mother leave you? </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Sorry. Let’s not talk about me anymore. It spoils our drinks.</font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: I don’t think so. It is okay to be this way. Life is not always happy. Listening to your story reminds me of my past. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: About your runaway daughter, right. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: You are so sharp that it hurts. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: I hate being roundabout. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Oh, you guys are here. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: When are we leaving? Haschel has been drinking too much since he heard we are going to Rouge. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: That’s right! Drink a little more, and let’s leave for Rouge at once! Of course to save the world! </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Gimme a drink too. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: May I join? I wanted to talk to you, Miranda. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Same here. </font>

<p><i>Later</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Shall we go? </font>

<p><i>Meahwhile, in the Weapon Shop</i>
    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: So, we are leaving in the morning. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Yes, we are. What are you doing here? </font>

    <br><font color="#FF9933”>Kongol: We don’t know what will happen in ancient city of Winglies. We need strong weapon. Kongol doesn’t care about leader of creatures. Kongol goes with you to the end. </font>

<br><font color=" #006633">Albert: For me too, it is no longer the mere problem of the Moon Gem. I cannot ignore this crisis of the world. You didn’t imagine we wouldn’t go with you, did you? </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I didn’t. </font>

    <br>Manager of Weapon Shop: Hurry up if you want to buy. Humans and Giganto, your time is limited.

<p><i>Meanwhile, at the Gate</i>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Hey! Buddies! Caron was telling me about the teleporting device. It’s not like back home. And, when are we going? We already heard lots about it from Charle, and we found out where we should go. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: You are coming too? </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Of course! Without me, the strongest of all, you cannot save the world! Besides, I learn a lot following Dart. Everybody’s the same, Gigantos, Humans, and Winglies. And I can’t stand the destruction of a world where everybody lives! </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: I think for the first time, I agree with Meru. </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Is this the first time? </font>

    <br>Caron: Leave here tomorrow morning. By that time, I’ll be prepared so that I can send you on the way that goes to the Home of Gigantos from here.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: We can travel that far instantly. Then we might as well go directly to Rouge. </font>

    <br>Caron: Our power is becoming weaker day by day. That is our maximum power.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I understand. </font>

    <br>Caron: Take a boat to Rogue. It should have been prepared in the Twin Castle a short while ago.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Was there a dock in that castle? </font>

    <br>Caron: I asked King Zior and had him make one especially.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: I’m surprised that he listened to a Wingly. </font>

    <br>Caron: There are no Humans or Winglies when it comes to the end of the world. You don’t need to thank us. Now, it is not too much to say that the mission of the city is to send you off.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Yes. And this is one way, this city has been looking after the world. Let’s go back to Charle. She must have prepared bedrooms for us. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Charle, what is this? </font>

    <br>Charle: Oh naïve boy. Don’t you understand? It’s a send-off for great heroes.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: You shouldn’t have. </font>

    <br>Miata: Don’t be so shy.

    <br>Charle: Rosie, honey. You have been doing really great. Since the soul of the Virage Embryo, the God of Destruction was released, you have saved the world, let me see, at least 107 times.

    <br>Miata: Really. After even being called a Black Monster.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Stop it. The monster has… died. </font>

    <br>Charle: Zieggy is serious. And, he has everything to give birth to the God of Destruction. Only Dragoons can stop him. I wonder what Creator Soa is thinking. Like destruction or regeneration. I wonder why it wants us to go through a painful thingy.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: We will change fate. </font>

    <br>Charle: Everybody must survive, okay?

    <br>Caron: Now go. Zieg won’t wait for us.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Right. </font>


<p><i>They go through the portal and arrive in the Home of Gigantos</i>
    <br><font color="#FF9933”>Kongol: Home of Gigantos. </font>

<br><font color=" #990000">Dart: It was linked to here. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: It’s been a while. </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Caron and Gigantos were pals for a long time. Of course, it was when there were still some Gigantos left. There were nice Winglies like Charle. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: They weren’t all brutal people, unlike the legend tells. We have to rewrite the book in the National Library. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Yes, correct knowledge brings correct conduct. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: That’s after this journey has ended. Let’s go see King Zior. We have to head to Rouge on the Queen Fury. </font>

<p><i>In Fletz</i>
    <br>Giant Gate Keeper: Oh, long time no see folks! You are free to come and go as you wish.

    <br>King Zior: Dart. I have been waiting for you.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: What is this…?</font>

    <br>King Zior: We are seeing you off.

    <br>Emille: We received a messenger from Charle.

    <br>Lisa: Her name was Caron.

    <br>King Zior: Everything is ready for going to Rouge. The world must not be destroyed. Even if it was the intention of the creator, we are still alive and living. I beg of you. Please save the world. Commodore Puler is waiting for you in the basement. To carry our hope.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: So long. </font>

    <br>Puler: Oh, you are here!! Everybody looks confident. Although you are going to an unknown land, there is no hesitation or wavering.

    Haschel: Actually, it’s my home village…</font>

    <br>Puler: A man of the sea isn’t bothered by those little details! Anyway! We are ready to go! We absolutely have to stop the crazy conspiracy to annihilate the world! However, we should never give up rescuing our loved ones either! Let us be going, Dart! The ocean awaits you!

    <br>Kayla: The Commodore makes it sound simple, but I assume that this time it will be a long journey, won’t it?

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Yes. </font>

    <br>Kayla: Then, I think you’d better get what you need from the city and come back.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Thank you. </font>

    <br>Kayla: It’s okay. I am happy to help you, Dart. Besides… Please…! Please rescue Shana!

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: We give you our promise. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Of course we will! </font>

    <br>Kayla: I’ll be waiting for you on the boat!

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Let’s go. </font>

    <br>Kayla: I’ve been waiting for you! Are you ready?

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Yes we are. </font>

    <br>Kayla: Now, we are leaving!!

<p><i>They arrive in Rouge</i>

    <br>Town Dweller A: Wow!

    <br>Town Dweller B: Sail ho!

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: It’s been a long time. I wonder if anybody remembers me? </font>

    <br>Mayor of Rouge: Ha… Haschel!?

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Yeah! It’s me! </font>

    <br>Mayor of Rouge: Well, it’s been, maybe 20 years!? You’ve been gone such a long time!! How have you been!?

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: I was looking for my runaway daughter, but I gave up on it. </font>

    <br>Mayor of Rouge: Claire, huh? That’s… I feel sorry to hear that. And who are all these people? Are they your new pupils?

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: No, they are my friends. I’d like for you to get to know them. But we don’t have time now. I have something important to talk to you about. </font>

    <br>Mayor of Rouge: All right. Come up. I’ll listen to you. Come on, get over! The floor’s gonna give way!

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Hasn’t changed a bit, huh? </font>

    <br>Mayor of Rouge: No kidding. This village is forgotten. We rarely have visitors from the continent.

    <br>Fisherman of Rouge: All we do is fish and sleep, fish and sleep.

    <br>Martial Art Master of Rouge: Practice and sleep and practice and sleep.

    <br>Mayor of Rouge: That’s about it. Nothing has changed since Haschel left the Village. Say, what’s cooking? You came all the way here, must be something important, huh?

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Yup. To be honest, we are looking for the way to the ancient cities. </font>

    <br>Mayor of Rouge: “Ancient Cities”? What the heck are they?

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Those were towns where the long gone Winglies lived. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Do you know anything about them?</font>

    <br>Mayor of Rouge: Winglies!? What on earth are they!? You lost me!

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: You couldn’t know. Let me explain. </font>

    <br>Mayor of Rouge: A world crisis!? That’s a pretty awful thing then!!

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: That’s why we are in a hurry. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Are there any old ruins around here? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Things that Humans couldn’t make. </font>

    <br>Fisherman of Rouge: How about this. There is a stick rising out from the sea. Could it be related?

    <br>Martial Art Master of Rouge: Oh! That thing in the sea! Indeed, Humans couldn’t have made it!

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Where is that? </font>

    <br>Mayor of Rouge: It’s in the middle of the sea. But you can’t get close by boat, cuz there’s an awful whirlpool. But, you can see it clearly from the cliff top. Well, it suddenly came up, so you wouldn’t have known about it.

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Shall we try?

        <br>Mayor of Rouge: Hope it’s the one you folks wanna go to.

<p><i>In the next room</i>

    <br>Martel: Lil….

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Martel. </font>

    <br>Martel: You folks!?

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: You are from this village too, Martel? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Martel!! Now I remember!! When I left the village, you were still little! I didn’t recognize you!! </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: She is sick. How is she? </font>

    <br>Martel: Not good. But…. It should be okay with this Stardust. Now, I’m starting. I beg you folks, save Lil from her illness!!</font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: !! !! </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: !! !! </font>

    <br>Lil: I feel refreshed. I feel refreshed, like before I got sick.

    <br>Martel: Lil!!! Lil!!

    <br>Lil: Ma, I cannot breathe.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: (Let’s leave them alone.) </font>

    <br>Martel: Lil….

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Martel, here. </font>

    <br>Martel: Are you sure!? Thank you very much then!! (Gave Stardust)

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: !! </font>

    <br>Martel: It reminds me…. This one is the fiftieth Stardust. I made it!! I made it!! I collected all the Stardust in the world!!

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Martel, make a wish quick! </font>

    <br>Martel: I wish for happiness for my daughter. I wish a bright future for my daughter! </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: !! </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: !! </font>

    <br>Martel: Lil.

    <br>Lil: I… I had a strange dream. There was a woman. She said, “I’ll give you happiness.” Isn’t it strange? I’m already happy now. I got my ma, and baby brother. That’s happy enough, isn’t it?

    <br>Martel: I guess you are all right. <i>Hugs Lil</i>

    <br>Lil: Ma, I cannot breathe.

    <br>Martel: Oops, sorry! Thanks to you, not only has Lil found happiness, but I have too. In return for your favor, take this. I feel some special power from this stone. A really special one. It might be useful for your journey. Just take it! <i>She gives you the Vanishing Stone</i> Thanks a million! I won’t forget about you ever!

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: That must be what the Mayor was talking about. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: There was no “stick” 20 years ago when I was here. </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: It’s huge and more like a tower than a stick. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: This structure could never be made by Human technology. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Rose, do you know anything about it? You were there once, weren’t you? </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: That’s right. Rose is one of the Dragoons who liberated Humans. Don’t you remember anything? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Charle said the Signet Spheres remain in the Magical City Aglis, the Death City Mayfil, and the Law City Zenebatos. If I remember correctly… there was only the Magical City Aglis in this region of the sea. Charle must have made us come here because she thinks Zieg will go after the Signet Sphere of Aglis first. </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Rose, a question please! What the heck is the “Law City” or whatever they call it? What do they mean? </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: I was thinking about that too. The Crystal Palace was called the “Birth City” too. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: The Birth City Crystal Palace was a city where babies were selected to be born. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: “Select” babies? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Those with weak magic power weren’t allowed to be born. </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: That’s awful. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: And the Death City Mayfil was where the souls of the dead were sent to an infernal world. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Winglies in the past had even their destination after death decided for them. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Do you want to know anything else? </font>

<p>The Forbidden Land
    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: It was the capital of the Wingly world dominated by Melbu Frahma. It was the center of politics and the military. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: That’s why it was so damaged. </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: That’s the reason why it is the Forbidden Land now. </font>

<p>The Birth City/Crystal Palace
    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: I already told you. You are hopeless. The Birth City Crystal Palace was the city where babies were selected to be born. Those with weak magic power weren’t allowed to be born. </font>

<p>Death City Mayfil
    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Don’t make me say it again. Didn’t you listen to me? The Death City Mayfil was the city where the souls of the dead were sent to an infernal world. Winglies wanted to control even the destination of the soul after death. </font>

<p>Law City Zenebatos
    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: The Law City Zenebatos was the city where Wingly laws were made. Publicly, they claimed it was for justice, but in reality they were laws to judge “other species”. Also, trials and executions were carried out in Zenebatos. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: I can easily imagine what kind of trials there were. Gives me the creeps. </font>

<p>Magical City Aglis
    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: The Magical City Aglis was the city where magic was studied. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: It is astonishing that even though they had much more magic than now, they still studied it so deeply? </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: It would never happen now. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: You are carefree, Meru. </font>

<p>Quit
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: You really know this stuff. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: If it is Aglis, hoe can we approach it? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: We gotta hurry, or Zieg will get there first. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Well, we cannot go by boat. We gotta find some other way. </font>

<p><i>Scene in Mirror Room, Aglis the Magical City showing Wingly watching Dart, etc.</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: What’s wrong Rose? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: We were being watched by somebody. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: “Being watched”? !! </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: !! </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: What’s going on!? </font>

    <br>Mayor of Rouge: Th, the sea is splitting!!

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Let’s go! What is that!? </font>

<p><i>They all watch as Aglis rises from the ocean</i>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: The Magical City Aglis revealed itself. </font>

    <br>Mayor of Rouge: Haschel!! Is that what you were looking for!?

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: It seems like it! Thank god that it found us! </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Now, we can go in before Zieg! </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Let’s go! </font>

    <br>Boat Pop: No kidding! Ya folks are gonna put to sea, aren’t ya!?

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: We are going to go. </font>

    <br>Boat Pop: Don’t ya know what’s going on!? The sea’s split and weird stuff appeared!

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: That’s why we are here. </font>

    <br>Boat Pop: Ya folks are insane!!

<p><i>Later</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Oh my god! There is a road formed on the bottom of the sea! It’s true. If we take a boat, we can walk from midway… There is no need to hesitate. Let’s go into Aglis! </font>

<p><i>They enter Aglis</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: What’s going on here? </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Magic. Somebody’s supportin’ this with magic! </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: It seems we are invited. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: It’s convenient for us. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: We have no reason to say no. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: This door is not locked either. Dart, you go ahead and open it. Zieg will come here. To destroy the Signet Sphere. You will have to finally settle things. So I want you to open the first door. </font>

    <br><i>Dart opens the door and they enter a huge room</i>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: This is the bottom of the sea! </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: This is a great view. It’s worth waiting a long….</font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Don’t forget we were invited by somebody. Otherwise this will be the last we see. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: But, it’s incredible magic, creating this much space in the water. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: This city originally was not in such a suffocating place. All the Wingly cities used to float in the air. So it was easier to control the creatures below. And, that’s how it was until we shot them down. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: With my dad. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Yes, Zieg and me, and five other Dragoons together. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: 11,000 years passed since then and now we are here. Being here to protecting the Signet Sphere. It feels strange to me.</font>

    <br><i>The door closes</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: What’s going on!? </font>

    <br><font color="”#FF9933”">Kongol: Sea closed. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: What!? They don’t want us to go back! </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: They are playing hardball with us. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: What’s this? </font>

<p><i>Ruff enters</i>

    <br>Ruff: Ruff has been in here forever, ruff. I only know the view and sound in here, ruff.

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: It doesn’t seem to be harmful. </font>

    <br>Ruff: It’s rough, ruff. Ruff doesn’t want to say anything, but it’s a message so that it’s rough, ruff. “Welcome to the seven heroes fated to be here. And Rose, these thousands of years I have waited were neither as long as eternity nor as short as a mere twinkle of a star. People who confront their fate with courage….” I forgot the rest.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: How do you know my name? </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Whose message is this? </font>

    <br>Ruff: Ruff only knows what Ruff hears, ruff. Ruff doesn’t know anything else, ruff.

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Are you on Zieg’s side? Answer me, or I’m gonna mess you up! </font>

    <br>Ruff: “Mess you up”? Ruff has never seen it and doesn’t know, ruff. Show it to Ruff. It should be some rough stuff, ruff.

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Hey, Miranda! This baby didn’t do anything! Sorry we scared you. Oh. This baby’s made by magic! </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: By “magic”? There wasn’t even such technology during the Dragon Campaign. </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: You gotta believe this cuz it’s right in front of our eyes. But, this baby’s totally cute! </font>

    <br>Ruff: Ruff is cute? Then you all are not cute, ruff. But, Rose is exception, ruff.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: If you are going to treat me as an exception, why don’t you take me to the Signet Sphere? </font>

    <br>Ruff: It’s your own challenge to go by yourself, ruff. All is for the sake of the Psychedelic Bomb and Moot, ruff. Ruff is going, ruff. It’s rough, ruff.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Well…. We gotta go anyway. It’s a magic creature again. </font>

    <br>Spino: Don’t be mean, pino. It’s just a message, pino.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Gimme a break. Is everything like this in here? </font>

    <br>Spino: It’s Rose, pino. You are in the mirror, Rose, pino. It’s Rose who got friends and is in the mirror, pino.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Stop speaking in riddles. If you have a message, just say it. </font>

    <br>Spino: Don’t be mean, pino. Savan said, pino. “Zenebatos, which governs the rightful law, has lost its reason, and Mayfil, which governs over noble death, has been toyed with by devils from the infernal world. This city is no exception. My magic power is deteriorating and cannot prevent the invasion by monsters anymore. The only saving grace is my…. This city’s objective is about to be completed. You are the key. I have been waiting for you for thousands of years. Come, before he comes.”

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Savan. As if he knows everything. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: We will find out. </font>

<p><i>Later, they come across the Wingly Savan</i>

    <br>Savan: The time has come. The foreseen evil is coming. But my wish is now hereby accomplished after an eternity. I am Savan. I am a Wingly fated to wait. The Signet Sphere you are looking for is safe. It is protected by Last Kraken.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: You know everything!? </font>

    <br>Savan: I know there is no time left as well.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Who are you? What are you going to do… no, what are you going to make us do? </font>

    <br>Savan: I survived the Dragon Campaign, and continued studying magic to reconstruct a Wingly world. Yes, even making myself ageless and immortal. However, the world outside the mirror hasn’t required me. The world of Winglies is no longer desired. I, an immortal body with no purpose. 4000 years of solitude deprived me of everything. Even the significance of life and the meaning of death. But 7000 years ago, I was saved by Rose. I found the meaning of life in the Black Monster in the mirror. Rose, who is now confronting her fate. I restarted my study for Rose. And its crystallization is this Psychedelic Bomb and Moot. We will stop the murderous deeds of Zieg, who continues the plan of the creator, by using the attacking spell, the Psychedelic Bomb. And with Moot, we will completely seal the Moon That Never Sets.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: That is the answer to the riddle. No wonder it takes several thousand years. </font>

    <br>Savan: Moot will be completed soon. But, in order to activate the Psychedelic Bomb, I need the courage of all of you.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Our “courage”? </font>

    <br>Savan: It seems that my courage alone is not enough. The Psychedelic Bomb didn’t work. I guess I don’t have any courage.

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: That’s not true! You have courage, Savan! </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Yes, you have been fighting alone for thousands of years. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: But now, we are here with you. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Yes. Our intention is the same. </font>

    <br>Savan: You have to endure your own challenge. And we will pour the “courage” that is born from them into the Psychedelic Bomb and activate it. When you are ready. Come to me. Are you ready?

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Yes, we are. </font>

    <br>Lulu: Let me tall ya! Lots of the world’s magic was created here!

    <br>Savan: But, the newborn magic is a mere hunk of materials. Without heart, the real power cannot be employed. But we have here brave people who can remain just, and have the heart to bring completion to the ultimate magic. Please ignite the Psychedelic Bomb with your courage. Now, proceed to the chamber of challenges! You are the last. Please be here with me till then.

    <br>Lulu: At last, we’re starting.

    <br>Savan: No, this will be the end of my role. My fate of waiting as well. Shall we start the first challenge?

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Okay. </font>

<p>At Kongol’s test
<p><i>Rose appears</i>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: It seems like it’s just us. Why don’t we fight for starters? Are you scared because you lost many times? Or is the cheap pride of a Giganto stopping you? </font>

    <br><font color="#FF9933”>Kongol: Kongol and Rose changed. Rose doesn’t say such things. You are not Rose. </font>

<br><font color=" #cc33cc">Rose: Then die. </font>

    <br><i>She attacks Kongol, but disappears.  Emperor Doel appears</i>

    <br>Emperor Doel: Don’t tell me you are buddying up with your enemy.

    <br><font color="#FF9933”>Kongol: !! </font>

<br>Emperor Doel: You fool! What happened to my plan, the unification of Endiness!? Have you found the leader who replaced me!?

<br><font color=" #ff9933•>Kongol: <i>Takes Doel’s Sword</i> Emperor Doel, Kongol got new feeling. Kongol found new friends. Intention of Emperor Doel is in Kongol. Kongol won’t avoid Emperor Doel. </font>

<p>Kongol’s test ends

<p>Lulu: We saw the courage of a Giganto.

    <br>Savan: Real courage can be obtained when a person is released from the bonds of the past. We are starting the next challenge.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Okay.</font>

<p>At Miranda’s test
<p><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: I see. You are giving me a challenge. Let’s get it over with. </font>

    <br>Buckle: Don’t be so hasty, uck. Miranda, you are hasty, have a short temper and are hopelessly annoying, uck. You really have a short temper, uck. I have a question for annoying Miranda, uck. “Why are you here?”

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: For the world.  To save the world from annihilation. </font>

    <br>Buckle: I asked the wrong question, all were right, uck. Buckle lost, uck. Miranda won, uck. I lost so that Buckle die, uck.

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: What are you talking about? </font>

    <br>Buckle: Without Buckle, this space cannot exist. You die too, Miranda.

    <br><i>Screen goes black</i>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Where am I!? Buckle! Answer me! </font>

    <br>Buckle: You still don’t understand, uck? Buckle and Miranda died, uck.

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Don’t tell me I died!! I am still alive! Look! I still have my hands and feet! </font>

    <br>Buckle: To die is to vanish, uck. Now, Miranda vanishes, uck. Same as Buckle, uck.

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: What kind of a trick is this!? What did you do with my body!? </font>

    <br>Buckle: Miranda has done enough, uck. So that you vanish with Buckle, uck. Are you scared, uck?  Afraid, uck? Wanna cry, uck?

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: I cannot die now. I haven’t done anything yet! I cannot die if terror remains in the world! </font>

    <br>Buckle: Miranda is revived, uck. Buckle is revived too, uck.

<p>Miranda’s test ends
<p>Lulu: Buckle’s mean.

    <br>Savan: The person who knows the time of their own death has real courage. Hmm. That means, I too have…. We are starting the next challenge.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Okay. </font>


<p>At Albert’s test
<p>Minister Noish: Your Majesty Albert! It’s an emergency!

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Minister Noish, why are you here? </font>

    <br>Minister Noish: I was called by Mr. Savan! Serdio is in danger!

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Tell me more. </font>

    <br>Minister Noish: The mysterious eastern tribe is deploying an army around the border! In cowardice, they took advantage of your absence, King! Return to Indels Castle at once. Your people are waiting for you to come back, Your Majesty.

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: I… cannot do that. </font>

    <br>Minister Noish: Wh, why!?

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: I am a Dragoon, before I am a King. Minister Noish, please attend to the matter of the invasion by the eastern tribe. Do everything possible to avoid a fight. </font>

    <br>Lulu: That’s right. Don’t worry, there is no such thing as an eastern tribe. That’s our King.

<p>Albert’s test ends

<p>Savan: Albert had to weigh the world’s crisis against his people’s. But making cruel choices is the responsibility of a king. The real leader has to weigh the effects of a death. That is the courage of a king. We are starting the next challenge.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Okay. </font>

<p>At Meru’s test

<p><font color="#003399">Meru: Nothing is here. Boring. </font>

    <br><i>Younger Bardel appears</i>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Bardel!? Why are you here!? </font>

    <br>Younger Bardel: I came back from the infernal world to get revenge for my sister!
    <br><i>Guaraha appears and intercepts Bardel’s attack</i>

    <br>Younger Bardel: Are you interrupting me Guaraha!?

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Guaraha? </font>

    <br>Guaraha: You told me, Meru. You would come back to settle matter of his sister after the journey. So, you cannot die here.

    <br>Younger Bardel: Make amends with your death!! My sister admired you! How can you still live after taking the life of my sister!?

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: I still cannot die! I cannot do anything if I die! Even make amends!! </font>

<p>Meru’s test ends

<p>Lulu: It was tough, wasn’t it. Poor Meru.

    <br>Savan: Death does not make amends. “Making amends” only exists in life. We surely saw the courage of Meru who knew and chose to live. We are starting the next challenge.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Okay. </font>

<p>At Haschel’s test

<p><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: The completion of magic requires both the material and heart of the person who uses it. It is like raising disciples…. What is this? </font>

    <br><i>Sees Claire</i>

    <br>Lulu: And Claire left Rouge. I saw it through the mirror with Spino. If you could erase all your memories and go back to that moment, could you stop Claire?

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: I couldn’t stop her. It was the best I could do. </font>

<p>Haschel’s test ends

<p>Lulu: That’s right.

    <br>Savan: Accepting the past… it shows courage, too. We are starting the next challenge.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Okay. </font>

<p>At Rose’s test
<p>Savan: I would often think about it. The thing we are doing, namely Charle creating the Signet Sphere to seal the Moon That Never Sets, and Rose continuously killing the Moon Child. I prepared for the coming evil day with a new signet, Moot, and the Psychedelic Bomb. And waited until the moment. The road to destruction laid by the creator, Soa was supposed to be absolute. But evolution was stopped by us, Winglies. I would often think about it. Whether our deeds were the right thing. And will continue forever. I am afraid. Whether I will be myself until the day my body perishes and becomes dust. Will our intention be engulfed by the intention of the creator, Soa eventually? Is everything meaningless?

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: You go too far. We are neither immortal, nor gods. We are mere people. People should just live in the present. Because it means living for the “next” present. I have been that way. And I won’t change. When is my challenge? </font>

<p>Rose’s test ends

<p>Savan: We have finished the challenge to the six. You are the last one, Dart. Are you ready for the last challenge?

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Okay. </font>

    <br>Lulu: It’s the last! Pour your courage into the Psychedelic Bomb!

<p>At Dart’s test

<p><i>Shana appears</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Shana, is this an illusion? </font>

    <br>Lulu: It’s the possibility of the future.

    <br><i>Dart draws his sword and is nearing Shana</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: The sword!! I, I cannot control my body. What… did you do to me!? </font>

    <br>Lulu: You have to take up swords against Shana.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Stop it!! </font>

    <br>Lulu: Shana is the Moon Child that gives birth to the God of Destruction, as well as being Dart’s significant other. If you have to take up swords against Shana, what are you going to do?

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I will save Shana no matter what! </font>

<p>Dart’s test ends

<p>Lulu: That’s courage.

    <br>Savan: The courage to pursue your love will change even fate.

<p><i>Later</i>
    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Savan went ahead to see the results. </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: I hope our courage will be able to make the Psychedelic Bomb. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: It’s the creation from thousands of years of effort by Savan. We have a huge responsibility. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: We obtained an unexpected ally. Now, we can wait for Zieg at the Signet Sphere. We all know what this means, don’t we? </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: If we can stop my dad in this city, the world will be saved. That’s it. Let’s go. Savan’s waiting. </font>

<p><i>Later</i>
    <br>Savan: Look! The courage of all of you is adding up! The new magic will be born! Give me your hands! Give me your hands to save the world!

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: This is the Psychedelic Bomb? </font>

    <br>Savan: Oh… my god!! It is exceeding the limit!!

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Did it fail!? </font>

    <br>Savan: Don’t worry! It’s not a bad thing! Your courage was too strong!! My ultimate magic is now completed!

    <br>Ruff: Savan, at last I finished the preparation of Moot, ruff. It was rough, ruff.

    <br>Phewy: Our efforts will pay off, phew. Magic power as strong as the Signet Spheres is gathered in Moot, phew.

    <br>Savan: It seems we made it in time.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Does this mean that we can stop my father’s plan? </font>

    <br>Ruff: As long as Zieg doesn’t destroy Moot, ruff.

    <br>Phewy: It’s okay, phew. The strongest of all magic creatures, Last Kraken, is guarding it, phew.

    <br>Savan: Let’s activate Moot at once. We will put a new seal on the Moon That Never Sets. <i>Gives them the Psychadelic Bomb X</i> Let me show it. This is the Signet Sphere that has continued to seal the Moon That Never Sets, the flesh of the God of Destruction, the evil fruit that is settled in the sky…. And this is Last Kraken. A magic creature that was born to guard the Signet Sphere. But we have you. It may not be needed.

    <br>Lulu: And Moot will start working.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: That red light is Moot, the new Signet. </font>

    <br>Savan: Yes. When Moot is activated and the Signet covers Moon That Never Sets, the ambitions of that man will be terminated.

    <br><i>The ground begins to shake</i>

    <br>Savan: What if going on!?

    <br>Zieg: That was a poor introduction of me.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: The voice. It’s you Zieg! </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Dad! Where are you!? </font>

    <br>Zieg: In front of you.  <i>He is the Last Kraken</i>

    <br> Savan: Don’t tell me, it’s been manipulated!? It cannot be!

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Yes it is. It is controlling the heart of Last Kraken! Zieg! Are you saying the 10,000 years of rest brought you magic power!? </font>

    <br>Zieg: Yes. Isn’t it an astonishing evolution? Eventually, I will go beyond everything. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Father, tell me! Why do you need to annihilate the world!? </font>

    <br>Zieg: Because it is the intention of the Creator Soa. And now, it is my intention as well. Dart, are you pointing a sword against your own father, but also, pointing a sword against Soa, who created you? And Savan, don’t you think it is a waste to stop the birth of a god by disobeying the intention of Soa? You are all silly. It seems the Moon Mirror that Lloyd struggled to get was not necessary. Go, Last Kraken! Destroy the Signet Sphere and Moot along with this city!!

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Everybody, we gotta stop him!! I won’t let you have your way, father!! </font>

<p><i>Battle</i>

<p>Lulu: Danger, Danger!

    <br>Savan: The Signet Sphere is resonating with the runaway reaction of Moot.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Why!? We prevented the attack of Last Kraken! </font>

    <br>Savan: I got it. The field of power generated by the Dragoons triggered the runaway reaction. Sorry, I’ll teleport you!

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Savan!! You have to come too! </font>

    <br>Savan: I will see this to the end. You should hurry to the next city, the Signet Sphere of Aglis is now, being destroyed. <i>Teleports them away</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Are you starting it alone? And ending it alone too!! </font>

    <br>Savan: Even if my body vanishes, my heart will remain. It will give you wings to fly the sky, to the Moon That Never Sets, where Zieg is heading.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: I still have something to ask you! </font>

    <br>Savan: Rose, I am grateful. Rose, you… were… my….<i>dies</i>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: We have no time for being sad. </font>

<p><i>They find Buckle</i>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Buckle. You are!? </font>

    <br>Buckle: Miranda, you are still annoying, uck. Are other people safe, uck?

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Don’t say anything. </font>

    <br>Buckle: Savan died. Buckle and other creatures cannot live without Savan, uck.

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Can’t we do something for you? Can’t you be saved with a Dragoon’s power!? Answer me!! </font>

    <br>Buckle: Be quiet, uck. Good night, uck.

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Are you playing dead again!? Give me a break!! </font>

    <br>Buckle: We can meet again soon, uck. Closing… my eyes… and soon, uck….

    <br>Decal: Dart, Decal’s time is stopping, cal. I cannot roll anymore, cal.

    <br>Spino: But, before that, you must… see, pino.

    <br><i>In the mirror, they see Zieg breaking the Moon Mirror</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Dad, what are you doing!? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: The Moon Mirror is broken!? </font>

    <br>Spino: Because the Signet Sphere of Aglis was destroyed. He doesn’t need it anymore, pino. Zieg is in the Law City Zenebatos, pino. Go hurry, pino.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: But how can we go? </font>

    <br>Decal: We connected the teleport device, cal. Please keep rolling for Decal, cal.<i>Dies</i>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: He’s dead. He opened our road with his last power. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: We won’t waste your death. </font>

<p><i>Later</i>
    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: This must be the door to the teleport device Decal was talking about. </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: It looks like the one in my forest. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: This one can take us to Zenebatos instantly. It’s completely different. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Winglies had such astonishing magic power, moving between cities instantly like this. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: It’s astonishing all right, but I cannot accept life being generated by magic. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Me neither. It’s too depressing to be born just to do one thing. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: The Virage Embryo, the God of Destruction, was born for destruction only. Its existence might have the same sorrow. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Then let’s try to make it feel better. By making sure it’ll never be born. We gotta protect the next Signet Sphere. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Let’s go to the Law City Zenebatos. </font>

<p><i>They enter the portal and are teleported to Zenebatos</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:So this is the Law City, Zenebatos. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: It is the city where the legislation and administration of the world of the ancient Winglies were carried out. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: It’s an austere place. It seems like a place Albert would love. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Yes, I have a great interest in the way in which they managed their nations, However, I don’t think I can learn anything from such a mess. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: It fell more than 10,000 years ago. </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: It seems like it. But it’s different than Buckle. There is no heart in it. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: It is just like Zieg now. </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Hey guys! There is something coming this way! </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Wh, what’s this? </font>

<p><i>Coloon flies in</i>

    <br>Coloon: I am Coloon. I’ll be your wings.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Savan was talking about it in his last moments. “Wings that can fly the skies will be given”. It was about you. </font>

    <br>Coloon: Rose and people who are carrying the world. Although Savan couldn’t accomplish his objectives, he fulfilled his role at the expense of his life. Now, everything is on you.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I know. I will stop my father. And fulfill Savan’s will. </font>

    <br>Coloon: I’ll be here waiting for you. Whenever you would like to go back to the world, I’ll be your wings.

<p><i>Sidequest in Fort Flanvel</i>

<p><font color="#990000">Dart: !?</font>

<p><i>Faust appears</i>

    <br>Magician Faust: My name is Faust. The commander of the super Mobile fort Flanvel. Below is the Land of Taboo. Nobody is allowed to pass through. If you would like to stay alive, go away at once!

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: What is that? </font>

    <br><i>The Vanishing stone reacts</i>

    <br>Magician Faust: Oh, nooo…. That… that stone… is the Vanishing Stone.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Is this stone? </font>

    <br>Magician Faust: The Vanishing Stone was created by Melbu who even was afraid of my, my power. Oh no! My apparition… will… vanish.

    <br><i>Disappears</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Vanished. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: I think I remember hearing about this before. There was a wizard who was commander here at Flanvel during the Dragon Campaign. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: That was Faust? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: I heard that man was able to create an apparition of himself that was as powerful as him. He is guarding here with his own apparition. It seems he really doesn’t want anybody to go down below. </font>

<p><i>Later</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: What is down there? The two entrances over there. Faust is in one of them. !? What is this trembling!? Is the ground rotten? !? This ground is rotten too. Is this… a dead end? </font>

    <br><i>The ground crumbles beneath them</i>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Then, what was the apparition of Faust up there? </font>

    <br><i>The ground crumbles more</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: !! </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Run!! </font>

    <br><i>They miss the exit, falling below</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Where are we? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: It seems to be the bottom of Flanvel. </font>

    <br>Magician Faust: You crafty Humans. The sin of contaminating my sacred Flanvel is an idiocy worthy of total death.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: This is not an apparition or ghost! It’s the true Magician Faust! </font>

    <br>Magician Faust: It is surprising to see a person who knows my name after 11,000 years. Even more amazing it that you have the Vanishing Stone that turns away my apparition. It’s a miracle.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Has he been living since the Dragon Campaign just like you, Rose? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: It seems so. You stopped being surprised since you met Charle. It is not unusual to live for 10,000 years. You agree with me, Faust? </font>

    <br>Magician Faust: Hmm. Not bad being human and being ageless. And what is it you desire? Do you want to serve me, the ruler of the world?

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: You are the ruler of the world? </font>

    <br>Magician Faust: In the near future. After the remobilization of my Flanvel, the eternal absolute dominance which even Melbu Frahma couldn’t achieve. The day I, Faust, become the king of the world!

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: He’s annoying. What are we going to do, Dart? </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Let’s withdraw at once. We have to pursue my dad now. Besides…. Fortunately, it seems that he cannot move from here. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: You are right. </font>

<p>-OR-

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: !! We gotta finish him. We cannot leave such a dangerous guy alone. </font>

    <br>Magician Faust: Hmm. You are ignoring me, the feared wizard. I now understand… your desire. You desire a painful, wretched… death. It will be no problem. I’ll grant it to you now.

<p><i>Battle</i>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: The Dragon Campaign is not finished yet. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: We’ll finish it, by stopping my father. </font>

<p><i>Sidequest at Vellweb</i>

<p>Shirley: Rose, visit me again. But my power is at its limit. Please save the souls of the four Dragoons, who were companions.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Shirley, you have done well. But we have to pursue Zieg now. I will trust you to save the Dragoon souls.</font>

<p><i>They enter Syuveil’s room</i>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: (Nothing has changed here. Not even a bit. <i>Sees Syuveil</i> Syuveil…. It is such an irony that you who studied life and death cannot die completely.)</font>

    <br>Syuveil: Is that you, Rose? Is anything wrong, you brought a lot of guests with you?

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: I was asked by Shirley, and came to see how you were doing. How are you? How are your studies? </font>

    <br>Syuveil: Through the subjugation of Mayfil, I think I completely understand where life comes from and where it goes. Winglies have been manipulating souls, namely life, from Mayfil, the place known as the Death Capital, and the Crystal Palace, known as the Life Capital. We saw in Mayfil the destination of life. The darkness opened up into hell. The world of shadows, without light.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: That is why you cannot die completely. </font>

    <br>Syuveil: I don’t want to go to a world of nothing spread out on the tip of darkness. I don’t like nothingness. Where should I go!?

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: I’ll tell you now. </font>

<p>Battle</p>

<p><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Somewhere in the east country, there is a legend. “Life does not come from anywhere or go anywhere. It just goes around with all other lives. It is part of a great wheel.” </font>

    <br>Syuveil: I can come back… again. To the place with light…. To the place with warm lives.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: How… can I tell you? But maybe ahead in the “hell” you saw in Mayfil, there might be a place with light waiting for you. </font>

    <br>Syuveil: Yes. It is what I have to decide. Where I want to go now…. I must think it through…. Thank you, Rose.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Let’s keep going… Dart.</font>

<p><i>They enter Damia’s room</i>

<p><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: (Here too… the same as the past.) </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: (She is still a kid.)</font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Yes. She was 15 years old back then. She was younger than Meru.) </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: (Such kids could manage the power of Dragoons?) </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: (Yes. She was born between a human and a mermaid. So that she had a special power.) </font>

    <br>Damia: Rose, were you worried and came here to see me?

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Yes. </font>

    <br>Damia: Thank you as always. Rose, don’t go anywhere. Don’t leave me alone again.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: …</font>

    <br>Damia: Say something…. Rose, you will make me feel lonely like everybody else!?

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: No, I won’t. There is nobody who bullies you like in the past anymore. We won’t let them. </font>

    <br>Damia: Yes, Rose and the other Dragoons are all kind to me. But…. Why make such a sad face?

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Sorry, Damia. But, there is somewhere you have to go. Forgive me. </font>


<p><i>Battle</i>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Damia, everything will be fine. You won’t become lonely anymore. When you go there, everybody will be waiting for you.</font>

    <br>Damia: It’s true. I feel… I feel them. Are you coming, Rose?

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Yes. When the time comes, everybody goes there. </font>

    <br>Damia: Then, I’m relieved. See you.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Now, let’s go. </font>

<p><i>They enter Belzac’s Room</i>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: (Here too… the same as the past. He is…!)</font>

    <br>Belzac: Children…. I will realize the freedom you wished, and the future I promised to you. Children. Please watch us.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: (Is that soul one of the Dragoons that is trapped in this world?) </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: (Yes. His name is Belzac. He is the Dragoon recognized by the Golden Dragoon Spirit. But, what is tying him to this world?) </font>

    <br>Belzac: Is that you, Rose? And Zieg!! No, it seems not. Who are you?

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: It is a long story. We don’t have time to tell you about it now. </font>

    <br>Belzac: Yes indeed. The subjugation of Kadessa will be soon. This last strategy has to be completed for the sake of the children who were killed by Winglies.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: You haven’t realized it yet? </font>

    <br>Belzac: Realized what?

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: You… are…. No, not only you, but everybody but me has died. </font>

    <br>Belzac: Everybody… has died? And, that includes me? Shirley died too!? It… it cannot be!! I took the attack of Super Virage, with my own body… to be the shield for Shirley!!

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: You remember now….</font>

    <br>Belzac: No way! I don’t believe Shirley died!! I don’t believe it!!

<p><i>Battle</i>

    <br>Belzac: Now I remember. All the truth…. But, death is not as sad as I imagined. Thank you Rose.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: “It’s not sad anymore”. Yes. The Shirley you loved is there too. Let’s keep going. </font>

<p><i>They enter Kanzas’ Room</i>

<p><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: (Here too… the same as the past.) </font>

    <br>Kanzas: Who is it!? Oh, it’s you. You hate this place so much. What made you change your mind about coming here?

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: I didn’t change my mind. These dolls still make me feel nauseous. </font>

    <br>Kanzas: Huh! Say what you want! These are mementos to remind me of the taste of blood dripping from my fist! There is no reason to be criticized by you!

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: The people killed by you won’t be saved if they find a memento in such poor taste as their tomb. </font>

    <br>Kanzas: You…. Came here to become one of these dolls!?

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: I now understand the reason why you are clinging to this world. You haven’t killed enough. </font>

    <br>Kanzas: Then let me be satisfied with you!!

<p><i>Battle</i>

<p><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: I was surprised when you joined the Campaign be being persuaded by Shirley. But after all, it was to kill? </font>

    <br>Kanzas: Yes, that’s right. But, it wasn’t the only reason. I thought the nobleness of Shirley, which I could never have, would take me somewhere I could otherwise never know. Some bright place I couldn’t know. So, even after death, I have been looking for that place.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: The “bright place”…. I hope you can reach there. Let’s keep going. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I feel… refreshed. I wonder if the healing power of Shirley still remains here. </font>

<p><i>Meanwhile, in Mayfil</i>
    Zieg: …! Over 11,000 years and it still leads souls to hell. Maybe, it is connected to the Devildom. But, it doesn’t matter now. The plan determined by Soa will drink everything to the last drop.

<p><i>Later, when Dart and the others arrive in Mayfil</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Rose, what’s that? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: When there were still Winglies here, they used to suck souls from all over the world into that huge tower. So they could decide the destination of their souls. But, why? </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: You want to say it should have been destroyed during the Dragon Campaign, don’t you? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Both Aglis and Zenebatos were working. It shouldn’t be that strange. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: But we destroyed this place completely, so that they could never play with souls. But maybe this is…. Do the souls that couldn’t completely die gather here? </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I don’t like this. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: But, whatever happens as long as the moon is in the sky, we are fine. The Signet Sphere is still safe. </font>

<p><i>Later, in a room with a Dragon head and green light</i>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: This is the soul of Feyrbrand, the Green Tusked Dragon. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: That is Feyrbrand? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: It came out in response to the Dragoon Spirit of Albert. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: You said souls that couldn’t completely die gather here. Is it the same for Dragons? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Yes, probably the defeat by Humans, who were supposed to be less powerful than them, became a burden on their soul. If we kill it again, we can probably break the attachment. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: But we don’t have time to deal with them. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: No, we don’t. I feel sorry, but…. We have to catch up with Zieg, or the world will end. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: !? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: It seems we tempted it into fighting with us. </font>

<p><i>Later, in a room with a Dragon head and blue light</i>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Mine’s sparkling. This should be the soul of Regole! It says “kill me”. He doesn’t want to go to hell. Dart! It’ll be over quick! Let’s save Regole! </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Yes! </font>

<p><i>Battle</i>

<p><font color="#003399">Meru: He says he’s okay and he won’t be overwhelmed by the power of Mayfil anymore. Hurry up! We have to catch up with Dart’s father! </font>

<p><i>Later, in a room with a Dragon head and pink/white light</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Is this the soul of the Divine Dragon? </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Even the King of Dragons has attachments after its death. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: It is because he is the King of Dragons, that he cannot get rid of his pride. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: When the Signet Sphere is destroyed, the moon will fall. The moon is still up there, Dart! Now is the only chance we have to save the soul of the Divine Dragon! </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Yes! We will take the pride of the Divine Dragon! </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Yeah. Since you left us, we have encountered many enemies. </font>

    <br><font color="#339933">Lavitz: “Enemies”. That’s why there are so many souls that know you. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: …?</font>

    <br><font color="#339933">Lavitz: Sols that are attracted here remain with a variety of thoughts. That’s why they are attracted by the gate of hell. Negative thoughts like attachments are the favorites of the devils from hell. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: And those devils are driving Mayfil aren’t they? </font>

    <br><font color="#339933">Lavitz: Rose, there are so many souls that know you. Yes, there are countless….</font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Lavitz, tell me! Why have you appeared in front of us!? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Look at the back of Lavitz. There is something attached. It seems that is affecting the soul. It smells of Devildom. </font>

    <br>Zackwell: Oh, excuse me. My name is Zackwell. I am a resident of the darkness.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: You have taken over Lavitz!! </font>

    <br>Zackwell: Yes I have. The man insisted he was so worried about you that he couldn’t bear dying. I thought it was a little presuming, but I granted him momentary life.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: You!! Lavitz was my friend! How dare you! You will never get away with this!! </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Is this a dead end!? The wings of Savan!! Take us to the moon!! </font>

<p><i>Movie</i>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Dart! Look!! </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: That’s it!? </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Ahhh!! </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Ahhhh!! </font>

<p><i>Movie ends</i>

<p><i>Coolon crashes in the Divine tree</i>

<p>Coolon: Sorry. I cannot… fly… anymore….

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Coolon….</font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Everything is turning out just as Zieg wished. The seal of the moon was broken, and the terribly disastrous plan laid by Soa finally has started. Those Virages are merely advance guards for the primary, Virage Embryo. Is seems the birth of the God of Destruction will only be a </font>matter of time. Does the Divine Tree, which gave birth to all species, want this as well?</font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: The world is not over yet. We can still fight to save it, can’t we!? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: After you’ve seen those, you can still say that…. Let’s go. The Moon That Never Sets is waiting for us. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Rose, what’s this? <i>points at a shiny object</i></font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: It’s a fruit of the Divine Tree. It seems to be dried up, though. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: “Fruit”. Did all the species really arise from such small things?</font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Only the creator Soa knows that. So, it’s just a legend for us. But, we are standing on the Divine Tree which was supposedly in the same legend. We’d better believe it. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I guess so. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Let’s move on. We better hurry up or there will be no one even to tell the “legend”. </font>

<p><i>Later, they come across a stream</i>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">RoseThis stream…. It seems like it is sending a vital force to the Moon That Never Sets. It must be that the Divine Tree is getting ready to give birth to the God of Destruction. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: …! Then, if we take this stream in this….</font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Yes. It will carry us to the top. Let’s hurry. </font>

    <br><i>They enter the stream</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: What a stream! We got right up close. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: In addition, maybe because we let ourselves flow in the vital force, I feel revitalized. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: It means that the power of the Divine Tree that gave birth to all species is still alive. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: In order to kill all the species, it revived the power. </font>

    <br><i>Meru enters, followed by Hascel, and then Kongol (who shakes the tree)</i>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Landing succeeded!! </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Taa! </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: What is that? </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: It looks like a… bug. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Did Kongol’s landing awaken it? </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: … We gotta get going. It’ll be soon. </font>

<p><i>Later</i>

<p><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Yes. But look at that. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Is that the caterpillar from back there? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: It’s a miracle. There was an unhatched fruit left over. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: !! </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: It is a sub-species of a new insect. It was just born, and it is coming after us! </font>

<p><i>Battle ends</i>

<p><font color="#990000">Dart: We barely defeated it. Let’s go. We are almost to the moon. Moon That Never Sets…. It is spreading poison all over the world. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: In order to stop the poison, we have to reach the core of the Moon before it is too late. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Unless Shana and the “core” are wedded, the God of Destruction won’t be born. Right? It is a dilemma for us because we want to take Shana back. If we don’t meet Shana, and if we can destroy only the core of the moon, the world will be saved. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: But, Zieg is here for sure. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: That is the only chance to save her. </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: We will save both the world and Shana. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Fate is not in the hands of the creator. It’s in our hands! We won’t let Soa decide the fate of the world! That goes for Shana’s fate as well!! We will decide our own fate!! </font>

<p><i>In the Moon That Never Sets</i>

<p><font color="#990000">Dart: Is this the Moon That Never Sets!? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Yes. It has been long. Very…. Let’s get going. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: The moon is shaking!? Don’t tell me… the God of Destruction is about to be born!? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: It cannot be…! The birth of the God of Destruction is our death! </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: That’s right! We are still alive! Let’s go! Must stop my father! Wow!? Is this a forest? </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: I thought we stepped into the moon. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: But, indeed this is a true tree. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Oh no, were we sent to the ground!? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: No. Listen. It’s the heartbeat of the Virage Embryo, the God of Destruction. An empty body that is the living corpse from which the soul was taken out by ancient Winglies on the day it was conceived in the Divine Tree…. We must be in the moon. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Then no matter what it looks like, we gotta keep going! It looks like a Grassland. Miranda, what’s wrong? </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: I know this place. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Does it look like the forest of your home? </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Not only that…. It is the forest of Mille Seseau where I grew up. I’ll be back soon. Sorry, but wait for me here. There is something I have to check… alone. <i>Leaves</i></font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Miranda!? </font>

<p><i>Later</i>

<p><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: As I expected… this is the forest of my home. Why is this in the moon? This rose is….</font>


<p><i>Forest, years ago (Flashback…Miranda sees her mother with another man)</i>
<p><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Mother! Where are you going!? </font>

    <br>Miranda’s Mother: Go home, Miranda!

    <br>Man: Huh? You have a kid!?

    <br>Miranda’s Mother: Um, yeah.

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Mother! Don’t go! Father is calling you! </font>

    <br>Man: What are you gonna do?

    <br>Miranda’s Mother: Because I married that man, my life has been completely ruined. He hardly works, and drinks all the time with the money I earned! I don’t even have enough food and am starving everyday! I cannot stand it anymore!!

    <br>Man: …

    <br>Miranda’s Mother: A beautiful life must be waiting for me if I leave this forest! Yes, I can say farewell to this miserable life! Now, let’s go! <i>She leaves with the other man</i>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Mo, Mother! </font>

<p><i>Flashback ends, and the Rose is transforming into a monster</i>
    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Wh, what!? </font>

<p><i>Battle</i>

<p><i>During Battle, Miranda’s mother appears in the rose</i>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Why? Why did you abandon dad and me!? </font>

    <br>Face of Miranda’s Mother: A, Miranda. I had no choice….

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Shut up! Dad fell ill and I became an orphan. You can never imagine how I have lived since then!! </font>

    <br>Face of Miranda’s Mother: … Ahhh…. It hurts. I understand that what I’ve done is unforgivable as a mother. But, I want you to understand.

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: What do you want me to understand!! </font>

    <br>Face of Miranda’s Mother: I worked because I didn’t want you, a newborn baby, to starve. But he didn’t even try to work.

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: My father may not have been a respected man. But at least he was with me all the time, unlike you!! </font>

    <br>Face of Miranda’s Mother: … Ahhh…. It hurts. I can imagine how angry you are at me. But I never forgot about you, even for a moment.

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Don’t lie to me!! </font>

    <br>Face of Miranda’s Mother: It’s not a lie. I visited him so many times to take you with me. But every time, he just kicked me out.

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: What…? My mother was thinking about me. </font>

    <br>Face of Miranda’s Mother: You have the same name as the goddess of Mille. She is pure and loved by everybody. I named you that because it was my wish for you. … Ahhh…. It hurts. I am sorry to make you feel lonely. Miranda, forgive me.

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: [I’ll forgive you.] </font>

    <br>Face of Miranda’s Mother: Oh, you can forgive me? Thank you, Miranda.

<p>-OR-

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: [No! I cannot forgive you!] </font>

    <br>Face of Miranda’s Mother: Ah, Miranda. It’s painful. As long as you hate me, I can’t return to normal.

<p><i>Battle ends</i>

<p><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Mother, I was wrong. I entered the palace in order to preach love, and to build a world where everybody can live happily, but my heart was filled with sorrow and hatred. And without knowing, I was absorbed in fighting in order to ease my loneliness. I didn’t even try to understand my mother’s pain and agony, just accumulate hated, and hurt many people. I don’t deserve to be a Sacred Sister. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Miranda, what happened!? </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Are you really okay!? Your eyes are kind of watery. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Sorry. Please leave me alone now. Let’s go. That’s the only thing we can do now. </font>

<p><i>Later</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: What is this? We gotta go forward anyway. </font>

<p><i>Later, in the Bale-type building</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: There are people…? What’s going on? Why are people living in the moon? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: I still don’t know. But….<i>Cuts Dart</i></font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Rose!? What are you doing! </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: You feel pain, it is certain this is not just an illusion. This world is “reality”. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Indeed. I’ve never visited the moon before. But, I cannot help but feel I know this place. People’s faces, clothes…. It’s not a mistake. This is a building in Serdio. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: I have traveled all over Endiness and they have typical Serdian faces. Look, the girl over there…. Looks Serdian. No…. She is… not. (It cannot be!?) </font>

    <br><i>Claire disappears into another room</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Disappeared…!?</font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: It looks like that is a reality here too. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I understand… that this place is not what it appears to be, but where are we now? </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: A world behind the wall…. It seems as if the labyrinth of the moon is not refusing us. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: No, almost as if it’s maybe inviting us. </font>

<p><i>Later, they enter a “room” which is actually another world</i>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Minintos…. It seems this place belongs to them. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: I think they were the 99th species. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Maybe they can tell us something about this place. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: <i>Sees Claire</i>(!?)</font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: You don’t seem to be one of the Minintos. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Look at her closely. It’s the girl in the room we came from. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Oh. She’s the girl who disappeared into the wall, isn’t she!? <i>Approaches her</i> Hi, what are you doing here? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Dart! This girl… doesn’t know about you yet. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: What are you talking about? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Let me go now. She is… Claire. She is inviting me. Sorry… but please wait for me here. <i>Leaves</i></font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Haschel!? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Haschel was right. The girl is inviting Haschel, not you. We can only wait for him. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Okay, but, as with Miranda, what’s going on in the moon? </font>

<p><i>Meanwhile</i>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Claire…. Is that you, Claire? Its me. Your father. </font>

    <br>Claire: Don’t come here! I hate you dad!!

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Claire. </font>

    <br>Claire: Always, always strict discipline…. What can I use such a thing for!? The power to destroy!? The power to hurt people!? I don’t need such power!!

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: I strictly disciplined you since you were little. I only had you. I had to hand my art, this ancestral art, down to the next generation. </font>

    <br>Claire: It’s not fair! I just want to sing songs, chitchat with my friends, pick flowers and fall in love!

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Our art was never meant to hurt people. It is a martial art to give life to people. Please understand. </font>

    <br>Claire: I don’t understand!!

<p><i>Battle</i>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Do you remember the first time we matched wills? You read my movement in a blink, and went on the offensive with swiftness. It was an innate art. </font>

    <br>Claire: I don’t think so. I am just a girl, like the ones you can find anywhere.

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: No! You can surpass me. Nobody has been charmed by the War God as much as you. Your hidden power…</font>

    <br>Claire: Ah…. It’s hot inside my body. Dad, help me. Somebody is taking me.

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: !! C, Claire, what’s wrong!? </font>

    <br>Claire: YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK! I hate you, dad!! You did this to my body!! It’s your fault, dad!!

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: No, it’s impossible. The transmigration of the War God…. Is she demonized!? </font>

    <br>Claire: YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK!

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Incredible. Nobody has ever reached that level except for the founder! UGH…. What…? The black art of Nagarujuna, Four-Gods-Destruction!! How did Claire learn…? UGH…. There is nothing I can do. </font>

    <br>Claire: I am the War God! I preside over the art of war, and beckon death. It was your desire to awaken me. I am the answer to your long quest.

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: No! You are my Claire! You are not the War God! Leave from the body of my Claire!! I can hear…. It’s the pained voice of Claire…. Hang in there, I’m coming to save you!! I feel your art down to my very core. [Mind’s eye, awaken!] I don’t care about myself. I have to save my daughter, Claire! I’ll focus all my body and soul into this, and kill the devil that possesses my Claire!!
        [Claire, please forgive me.] How can I exorcise this? Being obsessed by martial arts made my precious daughter endure suffering. Forgive me. </font>

    <br>Claire: Thank you, dad.

<p><i>Battle ends</i>

<p><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Forgive me, Claire. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Haschel, is it over? </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Haschel, you also saw, the past? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Yes, I did. But… the past wasn’t as bitter as I imagined. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: It seems everything, both the future and past, are filled in this moon. The future when the world will be destroyed…. And our past….</font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Both Miranda and Haschel were made to see the past by the Moon, right? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: They “see”. As I told you, we are in reality. It’s not illusion. Maybe they can do it because they are the 108th species and gods. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Let’s move on. We wasted lots of time. </font>

<p><i>Later, they exit through another portal.  The “ground” is made of stained glass</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: What is this!? The ground is so far away!! </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Are we floating in air!? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: You can stand up. It seems there is an invisible floor. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Are we really in the sky? </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: It looks like it. ‘Cuz, this is a cloud! Even I’ve never been in such a high place….</font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Really, anything can happen. Don’t just look at the view forever, we are moving on. </font>

<p><i>Later, they hear a roar and a shadow comes near</i>
    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: That is…. Oh no! Michael!! No! I couldn’t have been mistaken! I was with him for more than 10,000 years! </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Is that your dragon, Rose? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: It was the Vassal Dragon, my dragon! Run!! </font>

<p><i>They split up and jump into separate portals.  Albert, Meru, Haschel, Kongol, and Miranda in one, and Rose and Dart in the other</i>

<p><i>Albert’s group lands in the Home of the Gigantos</i>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: They’re not around here. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: It’s Dart and Rose. They should be fine like us. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Of course. It’s impossible for them to die from just an attack of a dragon. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: She called it “Michael”. Why did Rose’s Vassal Dragon attack us? </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: This is just my guess, but in the moon, I think some sort of feeling that exists in our heart materializes itself. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: You mean Rose had some caring feelings for her Vassal Dragon? </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: I flew around here and don’t you think this place seems like the Home of Gigantos? </font>

    <br><font color="#FF9933”>Kongol: Yes. But this was old Holy Land. Long long ago. </font>

<br>Gehrich Gang A: Hey!! Doel’s coming!! Run!!

<br><i>Doel and a few guards enter and chase off the Bandits</i>

<br>Doel: There will be no one to devastate the Holy Land of the Gigantos ever.

<br>Knight of Serdio: But Your Majesty Doel, we may be too late. Only if Your Majesty Carlo gives us permission to dispatch.

<br>Doel: Don’t talk about him. He is… no longer alive.

<br>Knight of Serdio: Your Majesty Doel! There is something in here!

<br>Doel: Come out. <i>Kongol, as a child, appears</i> A Giganto child!? I am the new King of Serdio, Doel. There are no more people to persecute you. You can live in peace from now on. What’s your name?

<br><font color=" #ff9933•>Kongol: Human! Get out! </font>

    <br>Knight of Serdio: Don’t be so disrespectful! His Majesty Doel tried to help Gigantos fight against Humans!!

    <br>Doel: I am a human, but before that, I am a man who wishes the coexistence of all species. Don’t you like peace?

    <br><font color="#FF9933”>Kongol: Me… Kongol. Everybody dead. Kongol alone. </font>

<br>Doel: Then come with us?

    <br><font color="#FF9933”>Kongol: Emperor Doel!! Emperor Doel!! Emperor Doel!! Emperor Doel!! I have something to do! I go now! Emperor Doel said. Strong leader is required to make equal world.

<br><font color=" #ff9933•>Kongol: Brother, Kongol is….</font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I understand that we lost everybody because the Dragon attacked us. But why? Why did your Vassal Dragon attack us, Rose? Was it to bring the two of us here, the place filled with Dragons? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: I think…. We will find out. Soon. Let’s go. Either to destroy the Virage Embryo… or to fight against Zieg, I need everybody with me. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Rose….</font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Don’t be so shocked. I trust everybody too. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Rose, what are these? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: <i>Pets the little dragon</i> This is a baby dragon. It was called a Pseudo Dragon. It seems everything, including the future and past, exist here. My favorite Pseudo Dragons didn’t make it to the present age. But I am encountering the past now. But, we don’t have time to be sentimental. Let’s go. </font>

<p><i>Later</i>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose:I knew it. I know this place. It’s where I met Michael for the first time. </font>

<p><i>Flashback from 11,000 years ago</i>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Darkness Dragon…. Sorry. We don’t have time. Winglies are mighty. Mighty enough to annihilate us, and the other species. In order to liberate Humans, we have to sacrifice you, Dragon. Now is the time to decide, extinction or war. </font>

    <br>Zieg: We choose “war”. The Dragoon Spirit left by the Darkness Dragon, and this newborn dragon will be the spearhead of the war.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: This baby needs a name. Black Burst Dragon, Michael. How about Michael? </font>

    <br>Zieg: Rose’s Vassal Dragon, the Darkness Dragoon, the Black Burst Dragon, Michael. It’s a good name. So now we can go.

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Yes. The real war has not started yet. </font>

<p><i>Flashback ends</i>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Michael! Don’t you recognize me!? </font>

<p><i>Battle</i>


<p><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Michael! It’s me, Rose! Don’t you recognize me!? </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: It seems not to be working. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: It’s out of control, just like the last time. He forgot the pride of the Dragon and turned himself into a mere raving beast. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: It has a wildness even beyond that of Feyrbrand! Damn!! What a Dragon! It yields to neither sword nor magic!! </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: The darkness Dragon is the strongest Dragon of all, having the best attack and defense, along with having the best agility. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I don’t need to hear about it! Is there any way to defeat him!? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Michael’s shell is special armor for the Darkness Dragon. It repels any attack by the enemy. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: What should we do!? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: There is only one blind spot. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: What is it!? Tell me now!! </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: God! What should I do!? <i>Tell Dart the blind spot.</i> After he shoots the black laser, his defense falls a second, showing his heart. That’s his only weak spot. </font>

<p>-OR-

<p><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: I can’t….</font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Rose!! What are you doing!! We have to do something or we will be finished!! </font>

<p><i>Battle ends</i>

<p><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: A Dragon’s body is capable of enormous endurance. But, it’s heart is not. After many fights, it becomes savage, and starts to blindly attack people and in the end, it won’t listen to the orders to Dragoons either. That’s why I killed Michael!! I killed him with these hands!! </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: That’s enough looking back at the past. You have lived for 10,000 years because you didn’t want to see the future to be destroyed, right Rose? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: You are right. Thank you. You reminded me of what’s important. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Let’s look for Albert and the others. Then we have to head to the core of the moon. </font>

<p><i>Later, in the Bale-like building</i>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Dart!! Rose!! </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: We were right about waiting here. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: All of you look… all right. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Of course. We cannot fall until we complete our mission. Now, before we leave, let’s exchange information. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I see. Doel was in the Home of Gigantos…. To save Gigantos. Hmm. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: It wasn’t the cruel uncle we’ve known. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: But it’s that Doel who killed King Carlo. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: I think we will find out what the moon wants to show us when we meet Doel. Besides, I think we have to see it in order to proceed. Given the facts so far. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: That’s right. Let’s go out to the town now. </font>

    <br>???????: *Hiccup* I am a son of the most wealthy house in this town. *hiccup* Come on, I’ll treat you to Spirits. Well, don’t worry about money. It’s on me. I am a rich man. *hiccup*

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: You are… Dran, aren’t you!? </font>

    <br>Dran the Rich: Indeed.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Do you know him? </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Yes. If he is my old acquaintance, this must be Bale 20 years ago. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: What!? </font>

    <br>Dran the Rich: I am…*hiccup* rich.

<p><i>Later, at the castle gate</i>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: I am Albert. Is Uncle Doel in? </font>

    <br>Gate Keeper of Serdio: I have been waiting for you.

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Waiting for me? </font>

    <br>Gate Keeper of Serdio: Please go ahead.

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Let me go alone from here. <i>Enters the castle</i></font>

    <br>Doel: I have been waiting for you, Albert.

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: You ”have been waiting”. Then it’s simple. You must know the reason why I’m here. </font>

    <br>Doel: You are here to find out the truth about whether I assassinated your father, my brother, and the reason. I would say… it was to save Serdio from an incompetent leader named Carlo.

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: My father was not incompetent! He was loved by his people and admired by his vassals! </font>

    <br>Doel: You were a mere six-year old kid back then. How could you know? What was brought on the people by overtaxation and disorder!? What can ministers soaked in corruption do!? You have been given false truths, so how could you know!?

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Even if… it was the truth, you shouldn’t have killed him! </font>

    <br>Doel: I guess you won’t be satisfied with words. Defeat me to find out the rest!!

<p><i>Battle</i>

<p><font color="#006633">Albert: Uncle Doel! Why did you eliminate my father!! </font>

    <br>Doel: It’s obvious! The people of Serdio wanted me! They desired my power as the true leader!!

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: It is not true!! What people desire is not power. It’s peace. </font>

    <br>Doel: Who do you think brought peace!? Who do you think brought order and hope back to Serdio!? Peace cannot be maintained without power!

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Uncle, you oppressed people with your power. How much value can we give to such a transient peace. What people need is….</font>

    <br>Doel: I don’t need to hear about things like justice or love!

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Power alone does not solve anything! </font>

    <br>Doel: The ideals and reality are different!!

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Wake up, uncle!! </font>

    <br>Doel: You are so persistent!! I cannot believe this. How can someone as helpless as you be this powerful!?

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: You wouldn’t understand this, uncle. You have had faith only in your own power. </font>

    <br>Doel: What did you say!?

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: I’m different from you and I am not alone. My friends have always been at my side during the many occasions when I was dispirited. I’ve overcome difficulties. </font>

    <br>Doel: Ha ha! Silly!!

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: When I was young, my father would often say that he didn’t have quite the stature to be king. Without Doel, he couldn’t do anything. He also said that it is you who was most likely to take the throne. </font>

    <br>Doel: I can’t believe it. That’s… why…. What did he see in me?

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: My father trusted in you. If you had gotten together and governed the country, this tragedy would never have happened. </font>

    <br>Doel: Albert! I’m a mere shadow of Carlo! I have no way left but to go forward!!

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Uncle!! </font>

    <br>Doel: Why? Why doesn’t my power work!? Why am I losing even though my power exceeds yours!?

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: For Lavitz, who devoted himself to me and fell. For knights who fell in battle. I have to win for them! </font>

    <br>Doel: Absurd! You are saying I have been wrong.

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: I lost so many people in battle. In my times of deep sorrow and despair, my many friends like Dart imparted to me courage and strength. </font>

    <br>Doel: I see. You are not fighting alone. That’s why I cannot defeat you.

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Uncle….</font>

    <br>Doel: I’ve been unwise to become infatuated with power. But, I have no regrets. Carlo, the king’s last words were, to take care of this country and you. We have different ways but they lead to the same intention. As a man who grieves for the country. The rest depends on you.

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Uncle!! </font>

<p><i>Battle ends</i>

<p><font color="#006633">Albert: It was the sad truth, wasn’t it? But the annihilation of the world will generate a sadness equal to the number of living people. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I won’t let it. I will save both the world and Shana! We are here for that! </font>

<p><i>Later</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:What is that? <i>Points to a Wingly palace</i></font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Incredible…. I cannot believe there is a palace more beautiful than the Crystal Palace. </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: That is the palace of the Winglies. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: It could not be made with human technology. </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Let’s go! </font>

    <br><i>As Meru crosses the bridge, it vanishes, leaving her by herself as she enters the palace</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: The path has vanished!? Meru!! </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: What are you doin’!! Oops…? Where is everybody!? <i>Turns around the se the Archangel</i> The… The Archangel!? Why are you here? </font>

    <br>Archangel: Meru… I know everything. You threw the pride of the sublime Winglies away, and have been with barbaric Humans, haven’t you.

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Archangel! Humans are not barbaric! They have many good things, which we Winglies don’t have! </font>

    <br>Archangel: Silence. Fine, Meru. I will make you remember the sublime spirit of a Wingly.

<p><i>Battle</i>

<p>Archangel: Wake up, Meru. You have already seen, the reality of arrogant and ignoble Humans!

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Archangel! Humans can never be ignoble creatures! They help each other when they are in trouble, even if they don’t know each other. And above all, they have dreams and hopes. </font>

    <br>Archangel: Silly. Humans are feebleminded even more than you would think. We have to rule them or eventually they will cease to exist.

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: I don’t think so!! All the lives in this world are equal. We shouldn’t rule or be ruled! </font>

    <br>Archangel: Silence, Meru! Have you forgotten what we have accomplished? We have stabilized a chaotic world, and saved tribes that otherwise would be extinct.

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Really! </font>

    <br>Archangel: Once there was 107 species, and half no longer exist. Our rule prevents the subversion of the world.

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: That’s wrong. ‘Cuz there were species that were stamped out during the Winglies’ domination! </font>

    <br>Archangel: They were meant to be extinct from the beginning.

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: You liar!! You destroyed them because they rebelled against the Winglies!! </font>

    <br>Archangel: Meru! A heretic like you disturbs our ordered world.

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Shut up!! You are not real! You are an invented god so they can justify themselves, Archangel. </font>

    <br>Archangel: It’s not true. I am a reflection of your mind. The disdain for Humans in your mind created me.

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: It’s not true! I don’t believe it!! </font>

    <br>Archangel: Meru, don’t lie to yourself. You think you can continue to deceive yourself playing a fool like that?

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: You fool! Don’t tell me crazy things!! I love Humans! I adore Dart, Shana, and the others! This is real!! </font>

    <br>Archangel: …Meru…

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Get out of my sight!! I love Humans. </font>

<p><i>Battle ends</i>

<p><i>Dart and the others enter the palace</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Meru!! Are you okay!? </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Of course I am!? Let’s go!! </font>

<p><i>Later</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: What is going on here? It is different from any part of the world we’ve known. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Indeed, the places we have been looked like places on earth. But this is a completely different world. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Don’t tell me, this is the core of the moon!? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: This look is appropriate for the world of the Virage Embryo, the God of Destruction, to be born. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Let’s hurry up! If this is our destination, my dad should be heading here too! </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: It is talking directly to our minds. </font>

<p><font color="#3399FF">Shana: … Dart. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Oh no! Is it Shana!? Wha…. What’s this!? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: It’s a Super Virage! I guess it is acting as a gate keeper to protect the God of Destruction! </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I don’t care what is waiting for us! Yaaaaaa!!! </font>

<p><i>Battle</i>

<p><i>Battle ends</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Was the Super Virage that we defeated, in reality, Shana? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Zieg!! You don’t deserve to use spirits!! </font>

    <br>Zieg: You say it even after this?

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Oh no, the Red-Eye Dragon still recognizes you!? </font>

    <br>Zieg: This is the truth. And the annihilation of the world tat is about to occur is the truth as well!!

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Dad, stop it. The power is… not generated for that!! </font>

<p>Zieg: <i>Looks at Shana</i>The time has come. <i>Eyes glow green</i> I no longer need this flesh.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Wha…!?</font>

    <br><i>Zieg faints as Melbu Frahma rises from his body like a ghost</i>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Melbu Frahma!! </font>

    <br>Melbu Frahma: I am the famous Melbu Frahma, supreme leader of the Winglies. I’ve been waiting for this moment for over 10,000 years!

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Why!? You must have been defeated by Zieg!! </font>

    <br>Melbu Frahma: It’s true that the sword of that man penetrated me. But, what vanished is only my flesh. I cast a petrification spell on the man, at the same time, I transmigrated my soul to the spirit. The sublime soul is immortal.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: How long have you been manipulating my dad!? </font>

    <br>Melbu Frahma: At that moment, I reentered the light. The first light after 11,000 years. When the Black Monster came to Neet, that foolish soul tried to release the power of the Dragoon, without knowing that I was waiting for that moment!!

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: So… it was then!! </font>

    <br>Melbu Frahma: I was released from the spirit and revived! In order to obtain an eternal body that is proper for an immortal soul!! And now, I am becoming a god!! <i>Goes up to Shana, takes her out of the embryo and places himself in it, and is reborn as the God of Destruction</i>

    <br><font color="#CC33CC">Rose: Is he merging with the Virage Embryo!? </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Is he going to be the god instead of Shana!? </font>

    <br>Melbu Frahma: You are right. I obtained the flesh of the God of Destruction!! I am the “God” himself!!

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: Don’t get conceited. I just ended up here while I was pursuing my own ideal. </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: I was gonna give you a little tour, but I ended up coming all the way here. But, I was right. I was right in following Dart. I realized it. In this world, there are lots of people living with lots of thoughts. So that there are lots of fights. But there is happiness and joy as well. This is such an awesome world, I won’t let him destroy it. I’m totally ready to go! </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: We have been together since the Moon Gem was taken and Lavitz passed away. We have fought, laughed, cried and walked together all the way here. But we have to end the walk here. For the sake of the goal that led us here. And… for the sake of all living creatures. Now, let’s go! </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Dart, you look just like me when I was young. Did you notice? I didn’t understand my daughter’s pain at all. That’s why I dragged it around until now. Shana is the chosen girl. As the soul to destroy the world…. When she discovered it, nobody but Shana suffered as much. When Shana comes around, I don’t know where we will be. But I know one thing, you are the only one who can ease Shana’s pain. But it won’t be realized unless we stop the Wingly who wants to be a god. Now! Let’s finish it up!! I’ll pound my secret art into his fat belly!! </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: When I decided to go with you, Queen Theresa told me. To learn the meaning of the “fate” that Soa gave us. This is what I think. Fate belongs to those who are living. We can destroy the “fate” that somebody else made up. And this is the moment. Dart, let’s do it! Stop him for all living creatures and their fate!! </font>

    <br><font color="#FF9933”>Kongol: Emperor Doel would often say, “To make a world where all species are equal, a strong leader is needed.” But Kongol knows. Anybody can make a world where all species are equal. Even you are not Dragoon. Gigantos, Humans, Minintos, Winglies, anybody. Anybody having the feeling can do. But Kongol found out. Anybody can destroy the world too. Gigantos, Humans, Winglies, gods, anybody. Kongol found out one more thing. We can stop him. Dragoons can save the world. Kongol, hero of Gigantos. Kongol doesn’t fear god. We can stop him. Dragoons can save the world. </font>
