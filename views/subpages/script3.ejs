<p><h1>The Legend of Dragoon Script - Chapter Three</h1>

<p><i>The Queen Fury arrives in Furni, the Water City.  Everyone gets off.</i>

<p><font color="#660066">Rose: There is the smell of blood around this place. But.... It's not bad at all.</font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: It's been a long time! </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Have you been here? </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Umm... y, yeah. Well, I'm very popular, that's why! </font>

    <br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol: Kongol crossed sea first time. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Furni the Water City. This port is the front door to Mille Seseau. Anyway, I wonder why Lloyd revealed his destination to us? </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I still don't know. Whatever he wants, this will be the end of it. </font>

    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: I agree. For the sake of the victims so far. It's not only that. In order to prevent there being new victims, we have to stop Lloyd. </font>

<p><i>Later</i>

<p>Resident Knight Harris: This seems to be all of us! Now! I'll explain the strategy! We have to overcome the white wolf called Kamuy that lives in the Evergreen Forest between this village and Deningrad!

    <br>Warrior: Did you call us just for that!?

    <br>Resident Knight Harris: Not only that. A boy from the village, Teo, disappeared in the Evergreen Forest! The strategy is simple! All of us will beat the bushes all over the Evergreen Forest! I promise a five times larger prize for the one of you who defeats Kamuy!! I promise the same for the one who saves Teo!

    <br>Bulgus: It's gonna be me!! I'm itching to do it!! <i>Sees Dart</i> Who are you? I've never seen you before. You look like you have a chance, but I'm getting the prize. Don't ever disturb me!

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: ...</font>

    <br>Bulgus: Are you scared out of your wits and cannot talk!?

    <br>Resident Knight Harris: Cut it out! We have to cooperate or we cannot overcome Kamuy!

    <br>Bulgus: Humph!

    <br>Resident Knight Harris: I'll let you know when we will start! Until then, you have some free time! You are dismissed!

<p><i>Later</i>

<p>Man at the rent-a-boat: I'll be right with you. Here is the license for the boat. The Mayor gave us an order to rent the boat to warriors for free.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Warriors? </font>

    <br>Man at the rent-a-boat: Well? You are the warriors who came to overcome the wolf, aren't you?

<p><i>Answer to "No, we are not."</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: No, we are not. We are just travelers. We've just arrived from Tiberoa today. </font>

    <br>Man at the rent-a-boat: You look fishy though. I cannot give it to you because there is something fishy about you.

<p><i>Answer to "Yes, we are"</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Yes, we are. </font>

    <br>Man at the rent-a-boat: From Tiberoa? With that huge boat?

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Yes, it is the Queen Fury. </font>

    <br>Man at the rent-a-boat: Well, wait a minute. One, two, three... seven!! Could you be the famous Dart and companions who conquered the Sea Dragon in Illisa Bay?

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I guess the story has traveled all the way here. </font>

    <br>Man at the rent-a-boat: Hon! Let the Mayor know about this!! He'll be happy to hear about this! Here it is! The License for the boat! Take it! (Acquired License for the Boat)

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Thank you. </font>

    <br>Man at the rent-a-boat: I have to thank you! Thanks to you, we can go fishing and go to Tiberoa! If you need anything, just drop by! We have accommodations too! I'll give you a good price!

<p><i>Later, in the Mayor's house</i>

    <br>Mayor of Furni: Are they coming yet? The heroes from Tiberoa.  <i>They arrive</i> Oh! I couldn't sit still. I was just pacing around waiting for you! The story of your heroic deeds in Tiberoa has reached us here in Furni! It is wonderful what you did! And now I would like you to listen to my story!

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: P, Please wait. I don't know what you are talking about. </font>

    <br>Mayor of Furni: I would like to talk briefly about the sad situation in this village. Would you please listen to me?

<p><i>Answer to "Sorry, we have no time"</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Sorry, we have no time. </font>

    <br>Mayor of Furni: Oh.... Well, I see.

<p><i>Answer to "Okay."</i>

<p><font color="#3399FF">Shana: What's wrong? </font>

    <br>Mayor of Furni: This is... my daughter Fa. Since that horrible incident, she hasn't opened her mouth.

    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: Is the story... about the incident? </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Okay.  I understand. Tell us. </font>

    <br>Mayor of Furni: This is... my daughter Fa.

    <br>Mayor of Furni: A few days ago, my daughter was attacked by a wolf. Fortunately, the injury was not bad, however, since then, she hasn't talked at all. Probably from the shock of the incident.

<p><font color="#3399FF">Shana: Poor thing. </font>

    <br>Mayor of Furni: The wolf is becoming more savage every day. Now, he has been joined by monsters from the Evergreen Forest, and they attack people!

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: I see. The warriors outside are the group headed for battle. Indeed, if we finish off the wolf, your daughter may become better. </font>

    <br>Mayor of Furni: But it is more complicated than that. The wolf called Kamuy that attacked Fa was kept by a boy of this village, until recently. And the boy who kept Kamuy named Teo has disappeared! On the night Fa was injured, Teo disappeared from his home. Probably he feels responsible and he ran away. Teo has been Fa's friend since they were little. They were best friends.

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: And.... You want us to cooperate with you on your mission. </font>

    <br>Mayor of Furni: Yes. Of course I cannot force you. Now we have a lot of warriors. Maybe they are enough. Oh.... Sorry about this. I have made you listen for such a long time without thinking about you at all. Well, as my apology, won't you stay at my house for the night? It will be an honor to entertain heroes!

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Well.... Do you like Shana? </font>

    <br><i>Fa nods</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  For tonight only. </font>

    <br>Mayor of Furni: Thank you.  I am glad! Fa is happy too! She has been lonely since her mother passed away. Now, let me see. When you are ready to stay, come back. I will prepare dinner with Fa. Are you ready to stay here?

<p><i>Answer to "Not yet."</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Not yet. </font>

    <br>Mayor of Furni: I'll wait for you then.

<p><i>Answer to "Yes, we are."</i>

    <br><font color="#990000"> Dart: Yes we are. </font>

    <br>Mayor of Furni: Now, let's have dinner!

<p><i>After dinner</i>

    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: Yes dear? Are you sleepy? You want to go to bed together? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Probably she wants warmth. </font>

    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: Let's go to bed together. </font>

<p><i>Shana begins singing</i>
    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: !! This lullaby....</font>

<p><i>"Home of Haschel 27 years ago"</i>

    <br>Claire: Isn't it a lovely tune? This tune is a lullaby that I am dedicating to my future baby.

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: That might be better for her than mastering the martial arts. </font>

<p><i>Flashback ends</i>

    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: (She is sleeping now.) <i>Goes downstairs to Haschel</i>  Isn't it a sweet tune? I learned this from Dart. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Dart knew this tune? </font>

    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: He said that his late mother sang to him. It's a special lullaby for Dart. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: (What!! I see. It was not a coincidence for me to be here.) I'm going to get some air. <i>Leaves</i></font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: It reminds me that Dart has been outside on the roof forever. Why don't you join him? </font>

<p><i>Shana nods and leaves, then sees Dart</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: It's a tune from my memory. </font>

    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: Do you remember? When you first came to Seles. I was little and you used to sing this song to me. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I remember that. Back then I used to take care of you, as if you were my real baby sister, Shana. </font>

    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: *Chuckle* Like a "baby sister". But many things have changed, since then. You and I too, Dart. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Yeah. You and I too, Shana. </font>

    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: *Chuckle* Yes we have. </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: <i>(From the shadows)</i>(Childhood friend, hmm. I wonder how my childhood friend is doing.) </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: The Moon That Never Sets. I hadn't noticed, but the Moon has been involving itself in our journey. </font>

    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: My... my head hurts! <i>(Faints)</i></font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Shana!? </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: What's wrong!? </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Are you all right!! </font>

<p><i>In the morning</i>

    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: Ahh.... I'm fine now. I can leave anytime. </font>

    <br>Mayor of Furni: Are you really okay!? You can stay here forever if you like!

    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: Thank you very much. But I really have to go. I'll see you soon. Let's go. We have to find Lloyd soon or it will be too late. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I'm with ya.</font>

<p><i>Later, in the Evergreen forest</i>

    <br>Warrior: He, Help!!

    <br>Warrior: I'll be killed!!

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: !! This is Kamuy!? </font>

    <br>Resident Knight Harris: Everybody surround it!! Finally I found it!

    <br>Bulgus: I'll get him and I'll get the five times larger prize!! Let me kill it!!

    <br>Teo: Stop it!!

    <br>Resident Knight Harris: Teo!! You are all right!!

    <br>Teo: Everybody listen! It was not Kamuy's fault! It was a different monster that attacked Fa!

    <br>Resident Knight Harris: Teo!! Leave Kamuy!!

    <br>Teo: No way!! Cuz Kamuy protected Fa! So I'll protect Kamuy this time!! Please!! Don't kill Kamuy!!

    <br>Resident Knight Harris: Teo! It's no longer the Kamuy you knew! Many other people were attacked by it! Guys! Let's grab Teo first!

    <br>Teo: Stop it!!

<p><i>They run away</i>

    <br>Resident Knight Harris: Pursue them!!

<p><font color="#3399FF">Shana: The wolf called Kamuy. They say it used to be Teo's, I wonder why it became savage? </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I don't know. The only thing we know is that the wolf is a menace in the forest now. </font>

<p><i>Kamuy roars</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:!! </font>

<p><i> Answer to "Maybe we should advance".</i>

<p><i>Dart and the others approach Teo and Kamuy</i>

    <br>Teo: !! Go home! Kamuy's not bad! Go home!

    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: We met Fa. Fa is worried about you. </font>

    <br>Teo: Fa is...?

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: It's true. Fa doesn't talk anymore since you disappeared, Teo. It is because she really cares about you. </font>

    <br>Teo: Fa cares that much about me?

<p><font color="#3399FF">Shana: Fa needs you. </font>

    <br>Teo: But.... What about Kamuy? He's gonna be killed if I don't protect him!

    <br>Bulgus: That's right!! You pretended to not be interested! But you came back for the prize, right! But I won't let you! I'll finish the beast!

    <br>Resident Knight Harris: Teo! Come here! It's too late for Kamuy!

    <br>Teo: Don't come here!

    <br>Bulgus: He, Help!!

<p><font color="#3399FF">Shana: Dart! We have to let Kamuy stop! </font>

    <br>Bulgus: Arrrgggghh!!

    <br>Teo: Stoooop it!!

<p><i>Battle</i>
<p><i>Battle ends</i>

    <br>Teo: Kamuy! Don't die!!

<p><font color="#3399FF">Shana: I, I may be contradicting myself. But, I cannot leave this like that. White Silver Dragon.... Please, save... Kamuy!! <i>(Uses her Dragoon Spirit to cure Kamuy)</i> </font>

    <br>Teo: Kamuy?

    <br>Resident Knight Harris: Kamuy is becoming himself again.

    <br>Teo: Kamuy!!

<p><font color="#3399FF">Shana: I'm glad. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: The White Silver Dragon healed the savage soul that changed Kamuy. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Teo. Go back to Fa and show her you are fine. Kamuy can go back with him, can't he? </font>

    <br>Resident Knight Harris: Hmm, it seems he's not going to harm people anymore. Fine. If anything happens, I'll take responsibility. It will be the best for Teo and Fa. Teo, let's go home! Everybody's worried about you!

    <br>Teo: Okay! Thank you! Miss!

<p><i>They leave</i>

<p><i>Later</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: What's up? </font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: Please go ahead. I remember I have some important errand to do. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Hey, wait! </font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: I'll catch up with you soon. Look for Lloyd in the meantime. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: She is mysterious, as always. </font>

<p><i>Meru begins to sneak away</i>

<p><font color="#3399FF">Shana: Meru? </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Hee hee.... I now remember I have an errand too. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: You're not going to tell us the reason, either, Meru? </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: I'm just visiting my parents, that's all! </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: That's all? You should've said so. I will miss you, Meru. </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: I'll be back soon! See ya! <i>(Leaves)</i></font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: It's typical of Meru. Let's move on. </font>

<p><i>In Deningrad</i>

    <br>Bishop Dille: It is said that the Divine Tree that lives in our heart and the Last Fruit have been protected from evil by the Signets created by the ancient Winglies. The legend goes, "When the Signet is broken, the end of the world approaches." Just like the Last Fruit, we Humans are one of the fruits given life by the Divine Tree. For the "End of the World" to be a mere legend, we must remove evil from our hearts and live in honesty. It is our mission as children of the Divine Tree.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: A Divine Tree, I've never heard of it. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: We still don't know what the objectives are for Lloyd. Any information could be helpful. </font>

    <br>Bishop Dille: Oh, you must be travelers. Welcome to Deningrad. My name is Bishop Dille. I serve the Divine Tree.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I'm Dart. This drawing is what you were talking about? </font>

    <br>Bishop Dille: Yes, it is. The Divine Tree. But this is what we imagine. Nobody has seen the real tree. Nonetheless, we believe in the Divine Tree. It is the source of life in harmony. Would you like to know more about the Divine Tree?

<p><i>Answer to "No, thank you."</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart:  No, thank you. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Dart! Why did you say that!? Knowledge about the Divine Tree may lead us down the right road! Oh, Dart. You are pathetic. Knowledge reveals itself only to those who desire it. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: (He just wants to know things, doesn't he?) </font>

<p><font color="#3399FF">Shana: (But just listening to a story won't harm us, will it?) </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: (I was concerned about Lloyd, but if you insist, we can listen to him.) </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Therefore! Let's listen to the story of the Bishop! All right!? </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I take it back. Please tell us. </font>

<p><i>Answer to "Yes, please.</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Yes, please</font>

<p> [FMV/CG]
    <br>Bishop Dille: The Divine Tree is the tree of life. All life comes from this Divine Tree. In the beginning, nothingness filled the world. Then the creator, Soa, descended from the sky. He and his followers created the world. In the end, Soa sowed a seed to the earth. The seed soon grew, to be a great tree. The great tree bore 108 fruits. And various life forms arose from the ripe fruits. Thus, 108 forms of life were created to fill the world. The Divine Tree completed its role, but the story says it is still protected, by the Signet of Soa.

<p>[FMV/CG ends]

    <br>Bishop Dille: It is like this, the world was established with a fate determined by Soa.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: God's tree, sown by Soa, is the Divine Tree.</font>

    <br>Bishop Dille: If you would like to find out more about this, you can go to the National Library.


<p><i>At the library</i>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Is that the Mille Seseau National Library!! I can step into the treasury of knowledge. I wonder if I am capable of receiving all this incredible luck and still remain calm. No! I cannot! The treasure of knowledge is shining and calling me! </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Al, Albert? Are you okay? </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Let's go! </font>

<p><i>It's locked.  They go to find the librarian</i>

    <br>Librarian Ute: Who are you people? Do you realize that you are talking to Librarian Ute?

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: No. Sorry. </font>

    <br>Librarian Ute: So, what do you want? Have you interrupted my ceremony for no reason?

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: I don't like stubborn old guys because I want to be an adorable old guy. </font>

    <br>Librarian Ute: Did you say something?

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Please wait. We were told by Bishop Dille that there is a wonderful library here. </font>

    <br>Librarian Ute: If you want, you can just go to the library. ... Oh, wait. I locked the door when I left!

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: So, could you open the door? I would love the opportunity to touch such treasures of intelligence! </font>

    <br>Librarian Ute: All right. Stop looking at me like that!

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: I appreciate it! </font>

<p><i>At the library</i>

    <br>Librarian Ute: I'll let you in now!

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: He is such a haughty old guy. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Don't say that. We have to do what we can until Lloyd shows up. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: That's true. He used a Dragon and a Dragoon in Serdio, and in Tiberoa, he obtained the cooperation of a Wingly. We don't know what he will do here. This is incredible!! </font>

    <br>Librarian Ute: This is the knowledge source of Endiness! Go look for what you want!

<p><font color="#3399FF">Shana: The entire wall is filled with books. Maybe we can find out something about Virages and the Moon That Never Sets. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Doesn't looking at these things all the time have an affect on you? </font>

    <br>Librarian Ute: It made me wise!

    <br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol: Kongol feels dizzy. Gigantos lose to books. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Here is something about Dragons! It talks about Dragoons too! </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: We can say that the Serdian War was started from the Dragoon Spirit that was brought by Lloyd. </font>

<p><font color="#3399FF">Shana: Let's split up and look. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Let's just do it. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: I guess I have to use my brain for the first time in a long time. </font>

    <br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol: Can Kongol read human words? </font>

<p><font color="#3399FF">Shana: If Rose were here, she would tell us a lot. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: They will be back when they finish their errands. We have to do what we can do now. </font>

    <br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol: It is about Winglies, I guess. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: "You guess"? </font>

    <br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol: Kongol cannot read human characters. Kongol looks pictures. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Let me read it. "Winglies are people with wings of light who employ magical power. They had their glory 11,000 years ago, and had enormous magical power that could float colossal cities." </font>

    <br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol: City floats. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Yes. It is unimaginable in the current world. "They became extinct after the war with Humans who were seeking their liberation." But Lenus, who was a Wingly, was alive. Besides, us Dragoons are supposed to be only a legend. A legend does not necessarily tell the truth. Take a look at this picture. </font>

    <br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol: Humans and Dragons. No. Dragoons and Dragons. And what is this? </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Virage manipulated by Winglies.... Shana, did you find out something? </font>

<p><font color="#3399FF">Shana: This book is talking about Divine Moon Objects, but they are just divine objects from a legend to begin with. There are no details. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: If we can find out the meaning of the "Divine Moon Objects", we think we can find out what Lloyd wants. </font>

<p><font color="#3399FF">Shana: Okay, let me read the part I found. "After the Dragon Campaign, Humans controlled the Continent of Endiness, and divided the continent into four, and established three new countries. To the east, Serdio. To the south, Tiberoa. To the north, Mille Seseau. And to the west of the continent, the untouched land, the Death Frontier. Each country shared three divine objects inherited from the Winglies as proof of their alliance. The divine moon objects are said to conceal magical power, however, their usage is unknown." </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: "Usage is unknown.", hmm. His mystery must be hidden in there. </font>

<p><font color="#3399FF">Shana: I will look into it more. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: This book talks about the Dragoons. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: The Dragoons from legend? </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Haschel: Yes it is. The heroes of the Dragon Campaign. According to this, we are the first new Dragoons to come along since that time. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Maybe. Dragoons are to be called when history requires them. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: When history requires them.... Is that now? Lavitz was a Dragoon. And Greham, Doel and Lenus too. Were their deaths necessary? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: That is what.... Only history can tell. I, of course, don't know. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: However, it all started out from the Dragoon Spirit that Lloyd brought. If Lloyd is a part of history that is necessary...</font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Then our journey seems to be dragged along by his fate. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: "In spite of the fact that they were Humans, the seven heroes who led the Dragon Campaign to victory 11,000 years ago, crossed the sky and cast spells. After they fulfilled their roles, they vanished with the Dragoon Spirits as if it were some unavoidable fate". This legend seems to be telling us that after this journey, we will vanish. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: This is a marvelous place. It seems that all the wisdom that Humans can possibly know is here. I am reading a book on politics now. This is very....</font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Can you do politics after we take care of Lloyd? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Albert: Y, yes indeed. Now, let me read the portion that talks about Dragons. According to this, "Dragons are the second most powerful species of all 107 creatures given life by the Divine Tree. Their attacks and life power overwhelm others, however the creator Soa created a balance by reducing the dragon's intelligence. Therefore, they were to be controlled by Humans with their wisdom. During the Dragon Campaign 11,000 years ago, they had fierce battles against Virages manipulated by Winglies and couldn't avoid being annihilated." </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: But they weren't annihilated like the book says. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: True. And again, they were ruled by the Dragoons. I'll look for more. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: ? </font>

    <br>Librarian Ute: Hmm. Hmm!! It led to the Dragon Campaign! Hmm. Hmm! What do you need?

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Are you acting superior again? </font>

    <br>Librarian Ute: Of course. I am superior.

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: I prefer being a hit with girls over feeling superior. </font>

    <br>Librarian Ute: I don't care about those things! It seems you are interested in the Dragon Campaign. Winglies, Divine Moon Objects, Dragons and Dragoons. These all had something to do with the Dragon Campaign.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Then Lloyd has something to do with the Dragon Campaign? </font>

    <br>Librarian Ute: The Dragon Campaign is my specialty. Maybe I can be of assistance.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Tell me. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: We only know fragments. </font>

    <br>Librarian Ute: I see. This is the legend of the Dragon Campaign that I know....

<p>[FMV/CG]

    <br>Librarian Ute: There were seven Dragoon warriors in the legend of the Dragon Campaign. Dragoons reputed to be the incarnation of Dragons. With Dragons at their side, the Dragoons fought boldly. However, in the age where the legend was reality, the Winglies dominated all, even the gods. The gods answered to dictator Melbu Frahma's prayers and granted him ultimate power. But, the power was abused. The earth of St. Imperial Gloriano was scorched by the god's fire, and became ashy. The anger and sadness of the people was fuel for the Dragoon's cause. Then, at last, they freed the gods. Without the gods' power, the Winglies perished; and our age, the Human age, began. Thereafter, the gods floated in the sky. For 11,000 years, they have been looking over the world as the Moon That Never Sets.

<p>[FMV/CG ends]

<p>Librarian Ute: That is the story. Did you find out something related to Lloyd? Oh well, that's unfortunate. You are already here, so you might as well check the Reference Room upstairs.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Are there more books? </font>

    <br>Librarian Ute: No. It contains the historical material of Mille Seseau. For other people, it may seem to be mere trash, however, for our country, they are all historic objects. This is something left by the Black Monster that brought an inferno down on this country.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: The Black Monster!? </font>

    <br>Librarian Ute: It has already been 18 years. It is surprising that a young man like you knows about it.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I was born in Neet! </font>

    <br>Librarian Ute: God! Are you a survivor from the village!? This is the stained glass of the church in Neet. Do you remember seeing this?

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Yes. Faintly, but I do remember. </font>

    <br>Librarian Ute: It was really a monster. These are the only things that survived the black flame.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Do you know anything about what happened to Neet back then? Any survivors or....</font>

    <br>Librarian Ute: I know only one.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Who is that!? </font>

    <br>Librarian Ute: The Second Sacred Sister of Mille Seseau, Sister Luanna. It seems you don't know her. However, I can tell you a little about the Black Monster. There is a legend about the Black Monster and the Moon Child. Would you like to hear it?

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: [No, thanks.] Librarian Ute: When you are ready, come to me. I'll wait for you here.
        [Yes, please.] </font>

    <br>Librarian Ute: It is ironic, but.... The people who visit the church in Neet pray for their own happiness by looking at this stained glass which shows the legend of the Black Monster and the Moon Child.

<p>[FMV/CG]

    <br>Librarian Ute: Why did the gods...(sorry missing this part)

<p><i>Meanwhile in Neet</i>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: Nothing has changed. (Am I... hesitating?) It's silly. </font>

    <br>????: Mother.... I am back.

    <br>Second Sacred Sister Luanna: Mother, it's been a while. Since the tragic day, I lost my sight. I am able to see today, thanks to the love of many people like Setie here. May the Divine Tree bless all the victims of the tragedy. <i>(Turns around and sees Rose)</i>Who is it?

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: I didn't mean to surprise you. </font>

    <br>Second Sacred Sister Luanna: You are?

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: Just a traveler. Please don't be alarmed.</font>

    <br>Second Sacred Sister Luanna: There are people of Neet, and my mother, sleeping here.

    <br>Fourth Sacred Sister Setie: Are you here to visit the grave too?

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: I guess so.</font>

    <br>Fourth Sacred Sister Setie: Then, you know about Neet!?

<p><i>Neet 18 years ago</i>

    <br>Black Monster: Where is Princess Louvia?

    <br>Knight of Mille Seseau: I will never tell you! UUURRRGGGHH!!

    <br>Luanna: I... I can't see. Mom, I'm scared.

    <br>Luanna's Mother: Don't come!!

    <br>Black Monster: Where is Princess Louvia? Where did you hide the Moon Child?

    <br>Luanna's Mother: We don't know!! What kind of spitefulness do you have toward our village!?

    <br>Black Monster: Do you want to die with your daughter?

    <br>Luanna: Mom, I'm scared.

    <br>Luanna's Mother: Princess Louvia left for the sea. This must be enough to satisfy you! Now leave this village!

    <br>Black Monster: The chance to eliminate the Moon Child comes only once every 108 years. It's the time of birth when the moon glows a blood color. The newly born Moon Child has a magic power. That magic power changes everyone around into an evangelist for the god, a servant to help prepare for the descending of the god.

    <br>Luanna's Mother: Ah!

    <br>Black Monster: My objectives will not be satisfied until I kill every single person who was present as the Moon Child passed through.

    <br>Luanna: Mom...? Answer me...? It's hot!! It's burning. Mom.... Mom....

<p><i>(Flashbackends)</i>

    <br>Second Sacred Sister Luanna: It was a miracle that I survived.

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: I see. Then you were blinded back then? </font>

    <br>Second Sacred Sister Luanna: Yes. However, the god imparted me with something else.

    <br>Fourth Sacred Sister Setie: Sister Luanna can see people's souls! But, she can feel their pain too. Because of this, Sister Luanna has suffered.

    <br>Second Sacred Sister Luanna: Now I can appreciate this power that I have. Because, it allows me to heal the pain in people's hearts. If you need to heal the pain in your heart, please tell me. I can help you.

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: That's not necessary. By the way, are you done? </font>

    <br>Second Sacred Sister Luanna: Yes. I will go back to Deningrad soon.

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: May I join you? Even if you are with knights, the forest is filled with dangerous monsters. I can protect you from them. </font>

    Second Sacred Sister Luanna: I see. Then I'll ask you to come with us.

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: He.... Hey! I came all the way back here! You don't need to yell at me! Aren't you happy to see me!? </font>

    <br>Guaraha: I am very happy to see you!! But leaving the forest is our taboo! You left the forest, so I don't know if everybody else in the forest will forgive you, Meru.

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Who cares about taboos!? Everybody in this forest!? And the Humans outside!? Both of us are living in the same world. How come we have to draw a line and lock ourselves in like this!? </font>

    <br>Guaraha: That's what I wanna know. I have been living in this forest forever. I wish I knew.

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: I'm gonna ask the Ancestor! I won't ask you anymore! I'm home! <i>(Goes into the village and everyone stares at her)</i> Oops, it seems I'm not that welcome. </font>

    <br>Wingly A: It's Meru.

    <br>Wingly B: Meru is back!

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: This is my home! I can come home any time! </font>

    <br>Wingly A: Such selfishness is not tolerated!

    <br>Wingly B: There is no place to come home to, Meru!

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: But....</font>

    <br>Younger Bardel: That's true!! You are the black sheep of the proud Winglies! How dare you shamelessly come back!

    <br>Elder Bardel: I thought you were satisfied with you decadent human life, weren't you?

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Bardel? What are you talking about? </font>

    <br>Elder Bardel: Go back to the Humans.

    <br>Younger Bardel: And wait there, for the moment we destroy the Humans!

    <br>Ancestor Blano: Stop it!!

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: The Ancestor!! </font>

    <br>Ancestor Blano: You left the forest on your own volition. How come you came back?

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: I just wanted to see everybody. </font>

    <br>Ancestor Blano: Leaving the forest is an unforgivable mortal sin. Didn't you know that when you left for the world of Humans? As well as that, you could never come back here.

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Yes I did!! But it's strange!! The world is one hundred times bigger than this forest! There are, of course, bad Humans! But there are many good Humans too!! You never met them and you shouldn't hate them!! </font>

    <br>Ancestor Blano: There are people who hate and detest Humans just because they are Humans, but their number is few. We just want to protect our life. That's all. Humans have always been afraid of the magic power of Winglies. The fear eventually turns itself into a need to tyrannize us, and take some action. Either to subjugate or kill Winglies. That's why we need our own world, like this forest, where Humans cannot enter. Go back to the other world. Your existence angers the others.

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: I understand. I'll leave. </font>

    <br>Meru's Mother: Meru!

    <br>Meru's Father: Leave the girl alone!

    <br>Meru's Father: That's the rule. We are going.

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Mother.... Father....</font>

    <br>Ancestor Blano: It must be hard for you, but you must go back, Meru.

    <br>Younger Bardel: Get out of our forest at once!!

<p><i>Meru leaves</i>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Guaraha!? Wha, What are you doing!? </font>

    <br>Guaraha: Quiet. I want a talk between just the two of us. It seems you received a horrible welcome.

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: It's nothing to me. </font>

    <br>Guaraha: Stop talking tough. Meru, it was just bad timing. Everybody is feeling tense lately.

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Is that my fault too? </font>

    <br>Guaraha: No. Recently, the earth is surging. Don't you feel it, Meru?

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: I've been feeling it a little. The animals in the forest are acting savage. This must be the cause. But, what is this? </font>

    <br>Guaraha: Ancestor Blano said that it is an omen of a Dragon coming back to life. And, it is not the usual one. Even our ancestors who had much stronger magic power couldn't defeat it.

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Wh, what kind of Dragon is that? </font>

    <br>Guaraha: It's the strongest Dragon of all. The King of Dragons, with seven magical eyes. The Divine Dragon.

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Divine Dragon? </font>

    <br>Guaraha: The Ancestor says that the seal has half dissolved. That's why everybody is nervous.

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: B, but!! We have a Dragon Buster and a Dragon Block Staff, don't we? </font>

    <br>Guaraha: The sword for killing Dragons, the Dragon Buster, has been lost.

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: It, It wasn't me! </font>

    <br>Guaraha: We know. Because it was hidden with the staff in a place that only the Ancestor could open.

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: And... the talk you wanted between just the two of us is about the Dragon? </font>

    <br>Guaraha: That too. But what I really wanted to tell you is something else. Meru, don't leave me! I want you to be at my side! I can protect you if everybody opposes you!

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: You are kind, as always. But if you do, you will be hated as well. I gotta go. Everybody's waiting for me. </font>

    <br>Guaraha: You... have friends.

    <br>Fourth Sacred Sister Setie: It is my pleasure to meet the heroes who defeated the Sea Dragon in Illisa Bay! I was really lucky to follow her from Neet.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Sister Luanna, I heard about you from Librarian Ute. We have something in common, we are survivors of Neet. </font>

    <br>Second Sacred Sister Luanna: So you went through that tragedy.

    <br>Second Sacred Sister Luanna: What I remember is only the sound of terror. I am sorry. I don't think I can help you.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I see. But... it's okay. The fact that somebody survived that tragedy means I can have hope that continuing my journey will someday, lead to the Black Monster. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Yes. What do you mean the unusualness of my body? </font>

    <br>Second Sacred Sister Luanna: I see that you people have strong powers. A power that is beyond Humans. It seems that the source of your power is in turmoil. Another power that has influence over you is anticipating the liberation. That is what I see. That is all I can tell. If it confuses you more, please forgive me.

    <br>Fourth Sacred Sister Setie: Oh no! Sister Luanna!

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: Therefore, we have no choice but to count on the other weapon. </font>

    <br>Queen Theresa: What could that be?

    <br>Queen Theresa: If so, are you saying that Winglies still live?

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Uh huh. </font>

    <br>Queen Theresa: It seems that the myth of fairies in the Evergreen Forest area was true.

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">First Sacred Sister Miranda: Queen Theresa. I am heading to the Forest of Winglies with these people in order to borrow the Dragon Block Staff.</font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Are you coming too? </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">First Sacred Sister Miranda: Of course. The problems are too big to just leave to you. Besides, I want to see how far you Dragoons can go. If you really have the power as described in the legend.</font>

    <br>Queen Theresa: I beg you people, please save Mille Seseau from the Divine Dragon.

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">First Sacred Sister Miranda: Now, we are heading to the Forest of Winglies! No time for procrastination! </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Please wait. I don't see Shana. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Where did she go? </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">First Sacred Sister Miranda: What timing. Let's go look for her. We have no time to waste.</font>

<p><i>They find Shana in the next room</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Shana!! Shana! Are you all right!? </font>

<p><font color="#3399FF">Shana: Where... where am I? When... did I come here? </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: What happened? </font>

<p><font color="#3399FF">Shana: I don't know. But... that took me? </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Miranda, what is this room for? </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">First Sacred Sister Miranda: This castle used to be a fort for Winglies. I heard that this room used to be a chamber for a ceremony to seal something. But it was more than 10,000 years ago.</font>

<p><i>In the guest room</i>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Isn't it the reason the Divine Dragon made a raid on the Crystal Palace? In other words, he is trying to work off his hatred against Winglies. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Why did you come here alone? Were you called again, like the time with the Virage? </font>

    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: No, it was different this time. I woke up and I was here. I feel hot. It's gone. My....<i>(Her Dragoon spirit leaves her)</i></font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">First Sacred Sister Miranda: What's this!? <i>(The White Silver Dragoon Spirit falls into Miranda's hands)</i></font>

<p><font color="#3399FF">Shana: I cannot manage it anymore, I don't feel the power of the White Silver Dragon. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: You.... You are a Dragoon too!? </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">First Sacred Sister Miranda: Me!?</font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: Dragoon Spirits manipulate fate. Hmm. </font>

<p><font color="#3399FF">Shana: I can... no longer....</font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Shana!! </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">First Sacred Sister Miranda: Hey! What's going on!? What is this stone!?</font>

<p><font color="#3399FF">Shana: I... see. I passed out. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Are you all right? </font>

<p><font color="#3399FF">Shana: Yes, but I don't think... I can go with you anymore. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: There is nothing you can do in your condition. </font>

<p><font color="#3399FF">Shana: I knew it, from the day I looked at the moon in Furni. I was sure this would happen to me. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: We will be back as soon as we defeat the Divine Dragon. So, wait for me till then? </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Lighten up! </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: I will work hard for you, Shana! </font>

    <br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol: Kongol too. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: It won't be long. Dart will be back with you soon, Shana. </font>

<p><font color="#3399FF">Shana: Don't worry. I am accustomed to waiting. But thanks, everyone. Miranda. Please take care of... the rest....</font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: I know.</font>

<p><i>In the Evergreen Forest</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: A dead end. </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Here we are at the entrance to the Forest of Winglies. *Sigh* Maybe I'll be kicked out again. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Where is the entrance? I see nothing. </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: There is a magical boundary here. Winglies have locked themselves in the forest since the Dragon Campaign. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: How come they didn't live with Humans? </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: You know about the Dragon Campaign? </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: It is the war that Humans, who obtained the power of the Dragon, started in order to liberate themselves from the control of Winglies. </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Some Winglies are still angry about that. Besides, Winglies have a power that Humans don't have. The Ancestor told me, that the power draws a line between Humans and us. </font>

<p><i>Meru opens up the partal</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Meru, are you...?</font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Yup. I'm a Wingly. Are you surprised? </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Yeah! </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Why didn't you tell us?</font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Would you believe me? Would you consider me as a friend if I told you guys? </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: It doesn't matter. Meru is Meru, right? Now. Let's go see the Winglies. Now we are dealing with serious stuff. </font>

<p><i>In the Forest of the Winglies</i>

    <br>Wingly A: I wonder what would happen to us if the Divine Dragon came to this forest?

    <br>Wingly B: We would probably fight it with our magic, but probably we would fail given our current level of power.

    <br>Wingly C: But the Ancestor said that we won't become extinct if we cooperate with other species.

    <br>Wingly A: "Other species"? Are you talking about Humans?

    <br>Wingly C: That's right, but I wonder if everybody in the forest can understand that, including me.

    <br>Winglies A, C: !!

    <br>Wingly C: The seal!

    <br>Wingly A: Meru! The Humans!?

    <br>Wingly B: Meru brought Humans here!!

    <br>Wingly C: I'm going to let the Ancestor know!!

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Don't shoot!! They are my friends!! </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: We are not here to fight! We are here to borrow the Dragon Block Staff! </font>

    <br>Wingly A: The Dragon Block Staff!? Meru! How dare you speak about our secret to them!

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: But the Divine Dragon is now awake!! </font>

    <br>Wingly A: B, But.... What can Humans do if they cannot even use magic?

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Should we break through?</font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: No, we should not. We have to take some action or everything may be destroyed! That includes the Forest of Winglies and human cities! </font>

    <br>Wingly C: Everyone! Hold on! The Ancestor says he will meet with the Humans! You.... Please, don't agitate the people in the forest. We are not used to seeing Humans. But.... Watch out for the Bardel Brothers.

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: What do you mean!? Let's go, Dart! The Ancestor Blano is in the back of the forest! </font>

    <br>Wingly: It's an order of the Ancestor. I'll carry you to the back. <i>(Carries Dart)</i>

<p><i>They enter Meru's home</i>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Father, Mother, I'm home! </font>

    <br>Meru's Father: Meru, do you realize what you are doing? So, they are the Humans who have deluded you.

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Don't talk bad about my friends! </font>

    <br>Meru's Father: Meru....

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: I'm still me! I wanna protect everybody in the forest in my own way! With Dart 'n friends! </font>

    <br>Meru's Mother: The Ancestor believed in Meru and is allowing the Humans to pass through here. You have to believe in Meru, too.

    <br>Meru's Father: Humans over there. The Dragon is supposed to be your ally. Winglies and Humans are enemies. Why are you trying to defeat the Dragon with us?

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: The Dragon Campaign has been over for more than 10,000 years. Besides, there is no reason for our two species to fight each other, is there? </font>

    <br>Meru's Mother: Honey, our ideas may be too old. Please take care of Meru.

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: You don't need to say such a thing! I'm the one taking care of them!</font>

    <br>Meru's Mother: Oh, Meru is taking care of...?

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Yup! </font>

    <br>Meru's Mother: Who?

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Dart 'n everybody!</font>

    <br>Meru's Father: I assume there is no time for this.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: He is right, Meru. Let's get going to the Ancestor.</font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Okay, you are right. </font>

    <br>Meru's Mother: Your father talks harshly to you, but actually, he is happy to see your face. Besides, he likes Dart and friends.

    <br>Meru's Father: Don't be yapping about silly things and just go see the Ancestor!

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Okay! I will! </font>

    <br>Meru's Father: Your mother is right. Seeing you makes me feel relieved. You are living your own way.

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Of course! I am your only daughter, father! I... think a lot! Bye now! </font>

<p><i>Later</i>

    <br>Guaraha: Meru! I knew it! You are coming back to me! <i>(Sees Dart and the others)</i>!! You are humans! So, you are the "friends" of Meru?

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: That's right. This is Guaraha. A friend of mine. </font>

    <br>Guaraha: You said I am just your "friend"!?

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Um, we grew up together? </font>

    <br>Guaraha: You are my fianc�e!

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I didn't know you had a fianc�, Meru. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Hmm.... There is more to you than I thought, Meru. </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Wow! What are you talking about!? </font>

    <br>Guaraha: It's true, isn't it?

    <br>Miranda: I thought she was still a kid. Hmm. It must be true that the Winglies have a long life and they are not as young as they look.

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: What are you analyzing me for!? </font>

    <br>Guaraha: What kind of relationship do you have with Meru!?

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Relationship? We are just friends. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: At first, she insisted on following us. </font>

    <br>Miranda: Is that so?

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: We have no time to talk about that! Guaraha! Why are you cooping yourself up in here!? There are awful things going on outside!! </font>

    <br>Guaraha: As the Ancestor told us, the Divine Dragon has come back to life, hasn't it?

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Why aren't you defending the forest!? </font>

    <br>Guaraha: The other day, I let you in the forest, Meru. I'm on probation now. Of course I would defend the forest if I could.

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Whatever!! We are going to see the Ancestor! You just stay here and be gloomy! </font>

    <br>Guaraha: Meru, you have changed.

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: You can be changed too if you go outside, Guaraha. </font>

    <br>Guaraha: I.... There is a commandment for us Winglies. We cannot do what you want us to do, Meru.

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Yes, you can. </font>

    <br>Guaraha: ...

<p><i>Later</i>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Bardel! Are you bothering us again!? </font>

    <br>Elder Bardel: The Divine Dragon can be taken care of by us without asking Humans for help. Besides, we have no business talking to a betrayer who ran off to Humans.

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: What happened to you!? The Bardel I knew was much kinder, and wasn't like that! </font>

    <br>Elder Bardel: My baby sister was killed by... a human.

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Oh no!? </font>

    <br>Elder Bardel: My baby sister was influenced by you, Meru, and left the forest! Believing that the outside world was wonderful. We don't need Humans' help. Do you have something else to say? Get out!

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: There might be more people killed now! </font>

    <br>Elder Bardel: Good for you! It's a chance to learn how helpless you Humans are! But we Winglies won't die. Our magic power surpasses the Dragons'.

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: You are strong, huh? Don't make me laugh. I wonder if you have noticed you are declining because you cling to the glory of the past? </font>

    <br>Elder Bardel: What are you talking about?

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: You can barely fly and that's about it, right? </font>

    <br>Elder Bardel: Maybe you won't think that way after this!? <i>(Charges into Dart, who defends himself with his Dragoon spirit)</i>!? No way! Is this the legendary Dragoon!?

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Please let us take care of the Divine Dragon. </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: I'll come back to take care of your baby sister's matter, after my journey has ended. So please trust us for now. </font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: The ones who flaunt their power disappear when the truly powerful appear. I am going ahead. </font>

    <br>Elder Bardel: If we cannot even have revenge for our baby sister anymore... The Divine Dragon cannot be.... I feel weak in my knees.... I cannot move.... Is this real? Ahh!!

    <br>Younger Bardel: You wimp! Brother! How dare you Humans! Just because you are afraid of our magic power, you are sending the destroyers of old, Dragoons, at us. Silly Humans! I'll pass sentence for the sin of killing my sister! I'll annihilate them now!!

<p><i>Later</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: There is nobody here. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Where is the Ancestor?</font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: My body is being healed. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Is this the magic healing? </font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: I wonder if it is an apology for the discourtesy? </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Ancestor, sorry we are late. </font>

    <br>Ancestor Blano: Welcome. Humans and Giganto. I am Blano the Ancestor of the Forest.

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: I am the First Sacred Sister of Mille Seseau, Miranda. Please forgive our sudden visit.</font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I would like you to listen to our story. The Divine Dragon is....</font>

    <br>Ancestor Blano: I know. The Divine Dragon came back to life in the Mountain of Mortal Dragon, and there are Dragoons that have come to us. It seems that the times won't leave us alone. The messenger from the Crystal Palace, and the people who were fated to come here.... Our opponent is so enormous. We have to combine each of our strengths or none of us will survive. Neither the Crystal Palace nor our forest.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: You mean....</font>

    <br>Ancestor Blano: Let us put the power of the Dragoons and our wisdom together.

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: You will let us borrow your Dragon Block Staff!</font>

    <br>Ancestor Blano: We don't have the Dragon Buster now. So the Dragon Block Staff is our last resort. We no longer have the power to master that, however, if you, who rule the Dragons can use it, we can fight against the Divine Dragon.

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: I appreciate your kindness!</font>

    <br>Ancestor Blano: However, we cannot participate in the battle. We are all that remain. We cannot become extinct.

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: I'm going!! </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I know. You are a Dragoon too, Meru. </font>

    <br>Ancestor Blano: Go inside. I will show you the way to the Dragon Block Staff.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I'll meet you there, Meru. </font>

    <br>Ancestor Blano: You are attracted to those humans.

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Yup. They are really cool! Ancestor! I wanna go on the journey with them! And I wanna see... my mother and father anytime I want! </font>

    <br>Ancestor Blano: Are you telling me to throw our commandment away? It is not the right time yet. But eventually, in the near future, the time will come when us and Humans live together. Go with them. As a Wingly, go see Humans, or better yet, the entire world. Your experience will lead us.

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Okay! I hear ya! I'll meet you there! </font>

    <br>Ancestor Blano: If Meru is the one leading us to the outer world.... Where are those Humans leading the world to? It must be the flow of time. Only the fates can tell. The Dragon Block Staff is sealed in the Forbidden Land over there.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Forbidden Land. </font>

    <br>Ancestor Blano: It is the place where our hideous memory sleeps. It used to be, until 11,000 years ago, a palace for us Winglies and it was the place where eternal prosperity was promised. It was called the royal capital Kadessa. Now it is a mere ruin without a name.

<p><i>In the next room</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Are you sure? Is it okay to go in? </font>

    <br>Ancestor Blano: It is fine. Everything is in the past.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I see. We have to do what we can do now. </font>

    <br>Ancestor Blano: Are you ready?

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: [Please wait a little.] </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: What's wrong? We don't know when the Divine Dragon will come.</font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I feel some monster over there. </font>

    <br>Ancestor Blano: There is still some magic power over there. And it attracts monsters. It won't be an easy road to the Dragon Block Staff. When you are ready, come to me. I'll lead you to the Forbidden Land.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: This is... the wisdom of the Winglies!? </font>

    <br>Ancestor Blano: It's a ruin of their wisdom. Let's go!!

<p><i>In the Forbidden Land</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: So, this is the Forbidden Land. The ruins of past glory....</font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: No remnant of the royal capital remains</font>.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: What's wrong, Meru? You are shaking. </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Cuz I, I hear the outcries of the people who died here. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Are you going to wait in the forest, Meru?</font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: No! I'm okay! If I can't get past such a small thing, how will I be able to fight against the Divine Dragon!? </font>

<p><i>Later, in the old coliseum</i>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: It's such a large space.</font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Indeed. I wonder what it was for? </font>

    <br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol: Kongol feels.... Smells like blood. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: "Blood", and a large space. It sounds like a coliseum. </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Yes, it really was. I heard it from the Ancestor. Once upon a time, it was a coliseum. But it wasn't for regular fights that you won or lost. It was for matches to the death. Winglies would just enjoy the view from above... of fighters picked from among the dominated Humans, Dragons, and some Gigantos. I am the offspring of that kind of Wingly. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: The Ancestor told us that this is a mere ruin, didn't he? </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: ...</font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: What happened here happened in the past. No matter what sorrow there was, it is no longer our sorrow. Isn't that right? </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: There is nothing to worry about, Meru. The sins of the past are there just to tell us not to repeat them anymore. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Cheer up! Let's focus on moving on. </font>

<p><i>Path 1</i>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: What is this!? It's a dead end here. Let's go back. </font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: Wait! This is a Virage! And this scar!! It must be the Virage that killed Belzac. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: You say this is a Virage? </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: What are you talking about?</font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: It was a destructive weapon of ancient legend that battled throughout the Dragon Campaign with the Winglies. Although some still remain. </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: But it looks totally different from the one we met before. </font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: It's one of their subspecies, and from its shape, it must have had a power far beyond the one we saw. But, it's not a very pretty sight to see. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: !! </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: The Virage....</font>

<p><i>Battle</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: The monster from ten thousand years ago. Was it awoken by us!? Everybody hang in there!! This is half dead!! </font>

<p><i>After Battle</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Why do Virages wake up in reaction to us? </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: I dunno. The Ancestor never mentioned about this thingy. </font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: So, does this mean they were not just reacting to Shana? </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Shana.... I still don't know anything about the mystery surrounding Shana. There is no choice for us but going forward. Come on, let's go. </font>

<p><i>Path 2</i>
    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: That's right! This must be the seal for that! We can move on when we destroy'em all! </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I got it!</font>

<p><i>Later, at the Dragon Block Staff</i>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: This is the Dragon Block Staff!! </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: It doesn't look very impressive. Can we really constrain the Divine Dragon with this?</font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: You can never tell the size of the magical power from the size of the object. The power of the staff alone has been sealing off the Divine Dragon for more than 10,000 years. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: I see, then when we take this back and deploy our defense of the royal capital, the Divine Dragon will be no match for us.</font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: It won't be as easy as you imagine. The Divine Dragon is not the same as other Dragons. Even with the staff and us Dragoons, we will have reason for thanks if we can seal him back in. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Is Lloyd taming such a monster? </font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: Talking about that, I don't think it is possible. The Divine Dragon would never give in. They couldn't kill him either. That's why he was sealed in. It's way beyond Lloyd's ability to deal with. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Then, it means Lloyd has not taken any action yet? </font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: Maybe he cannot act. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: There is no sign he is going after the next Divine Moon Object yet. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: The moon... object!?</font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: You must have it in Mille Seseau, don't you? A Divine Object with a name starting with Moon? </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: I don't want to talk about it.</font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: How come? </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: It's not your business. Just focus on how you can bring the staff back now.</font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Okay. </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: I'm getting it! <i>(Flies up to grab it, but it's stuck.  She pulls harder and the room begins to shake)</i>Whoa!! What the heck is this!? </font>

<p><i>Battle</i>
<p><i>After Battle</i>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: We didn't know there was a guardian. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: The Ancestor should've told us so. </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: I didn't know that either. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Anyway, the Dragon Block Staff is in our hands. Let's go back quickly. !! It cannot be.... Is that the Divine Dragon!? </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Don't be silly!! It's too early!! !! <i>(Hears the Divine Dragon)</i>Oh no, Deningrad!!</font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: We gotta run!! </font>

<p><i>In the Forest of the Winglies</i>

    <br>Ancestor Blano: Did you get the Dragon Block Staff!?

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: We did! But the Divine Dragon!</font>

    <br>Ancestor Blano: I know!! I am teleporting you to Deningrad!!

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Ancestor! It's too much! You don't have power like the old days, do you!? </font>

    <br>Ancestor Blano: We have no time left to think!! Hunnnnnnnnaaaahhhhh!! Aaaaaahhhhhhhh!!!

    <br>Meru's Father: Ancestor Blano!!

    <br>Ancestor Blano: I'm fine. It didn't work.

    <br>Meru's Father: Not yet!! We believe in Meru!! And her friends who Meru believes in too!!

    <br>Meru's Mother: I would like to see the future that Meru and her friends create!!

    <br>Ancestor Blano: Guaraha!?

    <br>Guaraha: Go on! Dart!

<p><i>Divine Dragon CG</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: We're too late!! </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Is, is this Deningrad!? The Crystal Palace is destroyed!! Queen Theresa!! Don't be such a laggard!! Shana is in the castle too!!</font>

<p><i>In the Crystal Palace</i>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Setie!! Luanna!! Wake up!!</font>

    <br>Second Sacred Sister Luanna: Ah.... S, Sister... Miranda?

    <br>Fourth Sacred Sister Setie: Sister Miranda, are we... alive?

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Good. It seems you are not injured either.</font>

    <br>Fourth Sacred Sister Setie: I, I was scared.

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Stop crying. The Divine Dragon is gone. And we will take care of it.</font>

    <br>Second Sacred Sister Luanna: Did you get the Dragon Block Staff?

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Yes, we got it.</font>

    <br>Second Sacred Sister Luanna: Now, we can prepare for the next raid.

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: What do you mean "next"?</font>

    <br>Second Sacred Sister Luanna: The psyche that the Divine Dragon sent towards the Crystal Palace was a black, bottomless mass of hate. There must be a "next".

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: I won't let him!</font>

    <br>Fourth Sacred Sister Setie: What about Queen Theresa!? Is Queen Theresa safe!?

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Hey!! Wake up!! <i>(Punches the knight)</i></font>

    <br>Holy Knights Gate Keeper: Ah, yes ma'am!! Sister Miranda!!

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Take care of these two!!</font>

    <br>Second Sacred Sister Luanna: Don't worry. Queen Theresa is safe. Wink is fine too. Everything is fine, thanks to her.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Are you all right!? </font>

    <br>Second Sacred Sister Luanna: We are fine. Sister Miranda went upstairs.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: What about Shana!? </font>

    <br>Second Sacred Sister Luanna: She should be upstairs too.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Wink! Are you all right!? </font>

    <br>Third Sacred Sister Wink: I am fine. Sister Miranda gave me treatment.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: <i>(Sees Shana's room, which is destroyed)</i>!! Shana's room!! </font>

    <br>Third Sacred Sister Wink: Wait!! Miss Shana is alive! She must be upstairs with Queen Theresa.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I got it!! </font>

<p><i>In the Throne Room</i>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Wow! </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: What is this light? </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: What is going on? </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: I don't know. When I came here it was already like this.</font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Shana!? </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Queen Theresa!! Where are you!?</font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Shana!! </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Queen Theresa!!</font>

<p><font color="#3399FF">Shana: Dart? </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: It's me! Can you understand!? </font>

<p><font color="#3399FF">Shana: Dart.... Everybody.... You are safe. How about Queen Theresa? </font>

    <br>Queen Theresa: Ah....

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Queen Theresa!!</font>

    <br>Queen Theresa: Miranda?

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Don't worry. Queen Theresa is safe. </font>

<p><font color="#3399FF">Shana: I'm relieved. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: I couldn't live if something happened to Queen Theresa. I'm relieved. I'm really relieved. <i>(Begins to cry)</i></font>

    <br>Queen Theresa: You cannot call Setie a crybaby anymore.

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: I don't care! Please let me cry for now, just for now!</font>

<p><i>Later</i>

    <br>Queen Theresa: Everything has calmed down anyhow. Welcome back. And no one was lost. Fortunately, the damage to the people seems to be minimal. I assume we had the blessing of the Divine Tree.

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: What was that light? It was as if it was protecting Queen Theresa and Shana.</font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Yes, the light was....</font>

<p><i>Flashback to before Divine Dragon Attack)</i>

    <br>Queen Theresa: Are you feeling all right?

    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: Not really, but I cannot stand still. </font>

    <br>Queen Theresa: I see. It seems that all we can do is trust them and wait.

    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: Yes, Your Majesty. </font>

    <br><i>Ground begins to shake</i>

    <br>Queen Theresa: What is happening!?

<p><i>Flashback ends</i>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Oh, this must be a miracle! Shana! You brought us a miracle! My sisters were guarded by the same light as well! Everyone was saved by you!</font>

    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: But I don't know anything about this power. This power is forcing Dart to face danger. And, I harm people! The people in Seles too, it was my fault. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: That's not true! It was Doel who did that!</font>

    <br><font color="#3399FF">Shana: Who am I? <i>(faints)</i></font>

    <br>Second Sacred Sister Luanna: She passed out.

    <br><i>At the inn, Shana wakes up and is surrounded by the others</i>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: It was my fault. I didn't know anything and I told her too much. <i>(Turns back to Dart, who is leaving)</i> Where are you going? </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: To the Mountain of Mortal Dragon. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Are you leaving Shana like that!?</font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I'll come back after I defeat the Divine Dragon. Miranda, could you take care of Shana? </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Are you telling me to stay here!?</font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: The Divine Dragon is not the only monster in the Mt. of Mortal Dragon! You are a Sacred Sister of this country. There is no obligation for you to come with us. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Did you forget? I am one of the Dragoons, the same as you. I have no intention to withdraw from this battle. Besides, Shana told me. "Please take care of the rest". I intend to keep that promise.</font>

    <br>Queen Theresa: We have reached an agreement. Everyone, I am counting on you.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Yes, Your Majesty. Please trust us. I'll bring everybody here. </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Did the two of you have enough time alone? We can wait outside if you want. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: I didn't know you could be sensible, Meru! Ha ha ha! </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Of course! I learned how to care for others from them! </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: We gotta get going. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: We will be back soon. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Are you all right?</font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: I cannot believe your timing. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: That is no way to talk to a friend!</font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: I haven't seen your power as a Dragoon, have I? </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Are you saying you don't trust me!?</font>

<p><font color="#3399FF">Shana: Please stop. Miranda is fine. She can do better than me. </font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: I hope so. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Is she like that all the time?</font>

<p><font color="#3399FF">Shana: Actually, Rose is concerned about me. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: What a clumsy woman.</font>

    <br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol: Kongol is leaving. You rest. Good for you</font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I am leaving. ... Let's go the Mt. Dragon Tomb. </font>

<p><i>Later, in town</i>

    <br>Martel: I'm busy taking care of casualties! Oh, it's you folks.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: This is awful. </font>

    <br>Martel: Yes it is. It's not the time to discuss Stardust. I want to collect'em as soon as possible and go back to my village. But I cannot leave these people like this. I'll stay here for a while.

    <br>Casualty: Ex, Excuse me.

    <br>Martel: Oops, sorry!! Again, when you find some, please give'em to me, okay? It's hard to find Stardust, isn't it? I guess I knew it though. How about you? (Gave Stardust) Thanks! Thanks a million!! In return, take this. It's the "rare thing" I promised you. (Acquired Rainbow Earring) Thanks in advance for the next time!

<p><i>Later, in the Evergreen Forest</i>

    <br>Sacred Knight: The monster was headed in the direction of Deningrad, and then came back to the Mountain of Mortal Dragon!!

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Before the Divine Dragon left, did anybody pass through here? </font>

    <br>Sacred Knight: No, sir! No one, sir, we didn't even let a mouse pass, sir! Unless they can fly like that monster!

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Gotcha. Stay on guard here. We are off to defeat the monster.</font>

    <br>Sacred Knight: Yes ma'am!! Good luck!!

<p><i>Later, on the Mountain of Mortal Dragon</i>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: It is from the top of the Mountain of Mortal Dragon!!</font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: That was a magic power! An awfully powerful mega magic! </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Whatever it is, that is our destination. </font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: As if.... It is unburdening his anger all over the world. The anger towards the Winglies who sealed him. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: And us Humans who dominated Dragons. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Then, does this mean that Deningrad was chosen to be the place for the declaration of war!? </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: We will settle that on the top of the Mountain of Mortal Dragon. Before the next town becomes a victim. The sound of swords.... No, has somebody started to fight against it!? </font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: Let's go. Either way, we will have to join in. You can go back now. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: There is nobody who would think that way. </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Um. May I excuse myself a bit? </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: You are the representative of the Winglies! Come on! </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: And are you going back to your forest to hide?</font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: I, I was just kidding!! When I do it I can do it!! </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: I made up my mind. Anyway.... If the people of Serdio knew about this, they would all fall over. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Let's do it! </font>

<p><i>They charge into battle</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: !? Lloyd!? </font>

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: It is earlier than I expected. Well, it is the future King of Dragons. Even with the Dragon Buster, which can kill Dragons, he still gave me a hard time. But he is almost dead. There is no need for you to come in. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: You say you are fighting against the Divine Dragon!? </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: You broke the seal of the strongest Dragon of all, but you couldn't control it! It's the truth, isn't it!? </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: What are you yapping about!? We can kill this man anytime!! We have to defeat the Divine Dragon first!!</font>

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: The Sacred Sister of Mille Seseau, I see the replacement for that girl. How convenient for us. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Shut up!! </font>

<p><i>Small CG scene</i>

<p><font color="#990000">Dart: Urgh!! Yaaaaaaaarrgghh!! </font>

<p><i>Battle</i>
<p><i>Battle ends</i>


    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Th, that is...!</font>

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: Yes. This is the Dragoon Spirit. This is the soul of the Divine Dragon. The flame of a soul that sparkles only at the last moment of a dragon's life... its crystal is the Dragoon Spirit! As I expected, it doesn't sparkle in my hands. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Lloyd!! That was your purpose, wasn't it!? </font>

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: This is just a little prize for me. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: A "prize"!? </font>

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: I don't need additional power to destroy the world. The Divine Dragon was a mere obstacle to my ideal. I fought against it for that reason only. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: You're the one who formed the conspiracy to destroy the world! </font>

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: The King of Serdio, what brought you all the way here? Is it the frustration of having your Moon taken? Or your feelings toward your loyal friend, Lavitz? </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Don't even mention that name! </font>

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: It is too early yet to settle things. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Wait! </font>

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: Don't be so hasty. I'll see you soon. <i>(Leaves)</i></font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Where is he going!? </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: He is leaving the mountain! Chase him! </font>

<p><i>Around the corner, Lloyd is waiting and attacks Rose and Dart as they appear, blasting them off the cliff.  They fall and hit a ledge</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Lloyd! !! Argh!! I didn't know he was one of the Winglies!! Rose!? Rose! Come on! </font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: Ah. Ahh....</font>
    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Can you tell me who I am!? </font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: I thought... you were dead. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: ...?</font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: Don't worry, I am carrying out your will. We took this world back together, I won't let them ruin it. Virage... embryo. The moon... with black power. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: "Black Power"? Are you talking about the Black Monster!? </font>

<p><i>Neet, 18 years ago</i>

    <br>Knight of Mille Seseau: UUURRRGGGHH!!

    <br>Dart's Father: Stay here. Take care of Dart.

    <br>Dart's Mother: Your father is a strong person. You have that strength in you. So.... You can wait here by yourself, okay?

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Where are you going? </font>

    <br>Dart's Mother: I am going back to the village to fight.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Really? </font>

    <br>Dart's Mother: I will protect your hometown with your father. Live strong.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Mom? Dad? This is my dad's... important... shiny stone. Mom. Dad. </font>

<p><i>Flashback ends</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: "Count 108 years, and when the Moon That Never Sets glares red, the Moon Child descends to the earth and shall give a holy blessing to the world." Fester said.... What really appears is not the Moon Child, but the Black Monster. What kind of relationship exists between the Black Monster who destroys all and the Moon Child who blesses the world? (Rose, what do you know about this?) </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Dart!! Rose!! Finally! I found you guys!! Oh boy, Rose! She passed out! Move away! I'll carry Rose first! <i>(Later, when she's finished carrying them)</i>Darn! I'm beaten! </font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: It's my fault, letting him go.... I apologize for it. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: It is not your fault, Rose. Nobody knew he was a Wingly who can use magic. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Don't worry. We will find out where he went. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: I agree. Lloyd's objectives are still the Divine Moon Objects. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Miranda, there is no need for you to hide it. Tell us. About the Divine Moon Object in Mille Seseau. </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: It's not like you, Miranda. Don't hesitate. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: I guess, there is no choice but to tell everything. The Divine Moon Objects are said to be brought by Winglies. And, it is said that they have a dreadful magic power concealed within. That is the reason why they were never allowed to be taken outside. A national treasure that has been kept a close secret. It is called the Moon Mirror. The successive thrones have been the keys to opening the seal. Oh, it cannot be!</font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Queen Theresa is in danger!</font>

<p><i>Meanwhile, in the Evergreen Forest</i>

    <br>Third Sacred Sister Wink: I wonder where Sister Miranda and the other people are...? And, if they're safe?

    <br>Commander of Sacred Knights: To make sure of that we, the Sacred Knighthood, are going to act as reinforcements. Don't worry, there is no way our Miranda can lose.

    <br>Sacred Knight A: Yes indeed. We cannot imagine her losing.

    <br>Sacred Knight B: But, I cannot imagine that the Giant Dragon will lose either.

    <br>Third Sacred Sister Wink: Please don't say such an ill-omened thing!

    <br>Sacred Knight B: I, I'm sorry, ma'am!

    <br>Commander of Sacred Knights: Sister Miranda, Dart and company are legendary Dragoons. We might not be needed.

    <br>?????: Dragoons!? They are mere Humans anyway!!

    <br>Third Sacred Sister Wink: Who is it!?

    <br>Younger Bardel: Humans don't need to know my name!

    <br>Third Sacred Sister Wink: Oh no! Are you a Wingly!?

    <br>Younger Bardel: Yes I am! We were the rulers of you Humans in ancient Endiness!! And now!! I am your executioner!!

    <br>Third Sacred Sister Wink: Oh my god!!

    <br>Younger Bardel: This is what you asked for! This is the great battle of liberation!! And your scream is its overture!! You conceited Humans! Go to hell!!

    <br><i>(Younger Bardel attacks them, but Lloyd comes in and saves them)</i>

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: The conceited one is you. </font>

    <br>Third Sacred Sister Wink: Oh, you are... Mr. Lloyd!!

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: You are so easily overtaken. </font>

    <br>Younger Bardel: You blocked the magic power. Who are you!?

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: I don't need to answer you. </font>

    <br>Younger Bardel: Watch your mouth!!

    <br>Third Sacred Sister Wink: Mr. Lloyd!!

    <br>Younger Bardel: I won't let anybody hinder the liberation of Winglies!! I'll annihilate all Humans!!

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: "Liberation" of Winglies? Hmph! You are so old fashioned. A world without Humans? It won't be any different from the forest you are cooped up in. ... I have made many sacrifices for my ideals. But your ideals cannot be achieved unless you annihilate everything? </font>

    <br>Younger Bardel: Of course!! My grudge!! My hatred!! I will settle'em all with Human lives!!

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: You should not be alive.  <i>(Attacks him)</i> </font>

    <br>Younger Bardel: !? I, I won't die alone!! <i>(Attacks Lloyd, who drops)</i>

    <br>Third Sacred Sister Wink: Mr. Lloyd?

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: I went out of my way....</font>

    <br>Third Sacred Sister Wink: Oh, you are wounded!! Please let us treat you at the castle!

<p><i>Later, in Deningrad</i>

    <br>Commander of Sacred Knights: Sister Miranda!!

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Oh, Commander of Knights!! We were successful in defeating the Divine Dragon and!! What happened to you? You are injured!?</font>

    <br>Commander of Sacred Knights: Queen Theresa... Queen Theresa was abducted!!

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Wh, what did you say!?</font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: By who!? </font>

    <br>Commander of Sacred Knights: A man called L, Lloyd!!

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Do you know where he took her? </font>

    <br>Commander of Sacred Knights: Well.... Sister Wink might know something!

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: My sisters are safe, aren't they!?</font>

    <br>Commander of Sacred Knights: Everyone is waiting for the group to come back to the Crystal Palace!!

<p><i>In the Crystal Palace</i>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: What do you mean that Queen Theresa was taken away!? What happened!?</font>

    <br>Second Sacred Sister Luanna: Let me tell you. A few days ago, when the howling of the Dragon from the Mountain of Mortal Dragon stopped. We assumed he had been successfully vanquished.

    <br>Fourth Sacred Sister Setie: Everyone, everyone was happy about it.

<p><i>Two days ago</i>

    <br>Queen Theresa: How long has it been since we have stopped hearing the howling of the Divine Dragon?

    <br>Second Sacred Sister Luanna: It has been about one week now.

    <br>Fourth Sacred Sister Setie: Don't worry! Sister Luanna said "The feeling of the Divine Dragon is gone"!

    <br>Third Sacred Sister Wink: I am back. I have good news for you, Queen Theresa. As Sister Luanna said, it seems they defeated the Divine Dragon.

    <br>Queen Theresa: I am glad. Now we can focus on the recovery of the country. I appreciate it, Wink. Please give the knights their well-earned rest.

    <br>Third Sacred Sister Wink: About the knights.... My knighthood is currently being treated. A Wingly who had something against Humans suddenly raided us.

    <br>Queen Theresa: Winglies attacked you? According to Miranda, they are a friendly species.

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: Some of the Winglies are militant. </font>

    <br>Third Sacred Sister Wink: This gentleman repelled them so that we were able to come back to the castle safe and sound. Let me introduce him. His name is Mr. Lloyd, Your Majesty.

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: It is a pleasure to meet you, Your Majesty. </font>

    <br>Third Sacred Sister Wink: Not only that, it was Mr. Lloyd who gave us the good news of the successful vanquishing of the Divine Dragon.

    <br>Queen Theresa: ... How did you find out about it?

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: It was, a coincidence. I saw Sister Miranda and her companions who completed the vanquishing in the Mt. Dragon Tomb. </font>

    <br>Queen Theresa: ... I understand. Let me express my gratitude to you.

    <br>Third Sacred Sister Wink: Actually, it was not the first time I was saved by Mr. Lloyd.

    <br>Fourth Sacred Sister Setie: Oh! I remember! This gentleman is the man of fate Sister Wink was talking about, isn't he!? Queen Theresa, she was saved by the bandits in Donau by this gentleman too!

    <br>Second Sacred Sister Luanna: It wasn't a coincidence, was it? Helping Wink, and coming here.

    <br>Third Sacred Sister Wink: Sister Luanna? What are you talking about?

    <br>Second Sacred Sister Luanna: The murderous intention you conceal inside.... You cannot disguise it in front of me.

    <br>Queen Theresa: Wink, Setie, stay back. I felt it too, something very wrong.

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: I hadn't intended to make a scene. However, sometimes it can't be avoided. <i>(Disappears, then reappears behind Queen Theresa)</i></font>

    <br>Fourth Sacred Sister Setie: Queen Theresa!!

    <br>Third Sacred Sister Wink: Mr. Lloyd. What on earth...?

    <br>Queen Theresa: Do not come closer! What do you want!?

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: I desire the Moon Mirror. </font>

    <br>Queen Theresa: Moon Mirror! H, how did you know about it!?

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: You don't need to worry about that. You should just take me there, Your Majesty. </font>

    <br>Third Sacred Sister Wink: Answer me. From the beginning... from the beginning, it was your purpose?

    <br>Queen Theresa: Wink! Get away!

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: I... just desire the power to create a utopia. </font>

    <br>Second Sacred Sister Luanna: Queen Theresa! He is reading your mind!!

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: Shall we go to the last Divine Moon Object? </font>

<p><i>Flashback ends</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: The last Divine Moon Object? Is he going to end this!? Miranda! Where is the Moon Mirror!? </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: In the Tower of Flanvel, to the west of Kashua Glacier.</font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: Theresa is the key to the tower. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: I'll take care of the rest.</font>

    <br>Third Sacred Sister Wink: Sister Miranda.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: We will bring Queen Theresa back! We are not going to let Lloyd get what he wants! </font>

<p><i>Later, at Kashua Glacier</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: What a cold place. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: It pierces through my aged bones. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: It is a land where the earth is eternally covered under ice. I understand that is must be harsh on someone who has never been here.</font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Darn, I'm totally dying! Do you often visit such a place, Miranda? </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: It's been a while since I came all the way here. But, I would often come here to find solace for my loneliness.</font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: You've got such a kind mother like Queen Theresa, how could you have a "lonely time"? </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Her Majesty Theresa is not my birth mother. My true birth mother abandoned me. After that, I met Her Majesty Theresa. Her Majesty Theresa cherished me when I was alone, as if I were her real daughter. Since then, I've never felt loneliness again. </font>

<p><i>Later</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: !? What? </font>

    <br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol: Kongol feels. Monster angry. About we entered here. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: I cannot imagine what they are thinking to live in such a cold place. </font>

    <br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol: Monster, don't know coldness. Monster only knows to kill. It wants kill us. </font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Thank you, but no thank you. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Here it comes!</font>

<p><i>Battle</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Everybody watch out! It might hit us!! </font>

    <br><i>Battle ends</i>

<p><font color="#990000">Dart: We barely defeated....</font>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Haschel: Thanks to that, I got warmed up. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: Hurry up, we are moving on! The Tower of Flanvel is back there!</font>

<p><i>Later</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Look. </font>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: This is the Tower of Flanvel. It's the ruin where the Moon Mirror was placed.</font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: It's a swirl. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Again, this doesn't seem to be built by Humans. </font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: No, it's not. According to the legend, it was the Winglie's floating fort during the Dragon Campaign. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Haschel: This can fly!? </font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: Winglies in the past used to have an enormous amount of magic power. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Then it wouldn't be strange if this much power was concealed in the Divine Moon Objects. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: For the people of Serdio, for King Zior, for Princess Emille. No. This is a life or death matter for all of Endiness. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: That's even more of a reason. We must stop the ambitions of Lloyd here! </font>

<p><i>Later</i>

    <br><font color="#FFCC00">Miranda: The Moon Mirror is in there!</font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: The Dragoon Spirit of the Divine Dragon is resonating. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Lloyd!! Finally, we cornered him!! </font>

<p><i>Meanwhile</i>

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: I appreciate your cooperation. </font>

    <br>Queen Theresa: What... are you...?

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Lloyd!! </font>

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: Here they are. I just got all three Divine Moon Objects. Now the world will be reborn into the utopia that Emperor Diaz and I desire. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: The world will be reborn!? What are you talking about!? </font>

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: You should know, Your Majesty. The evolutionary plan created by the great will, Soa. And the flow of evolution woven by the Divine Tree. You Humans are merely 106th in the plan. And... we Winglies are the 107th in the plan. I desire the 108th evolution! I desire a utopia created by the last species! For that, I will use every conceivable means!! </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Lloyd, that's all you want to say!? </font>

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: I'll let my sword say the rest. Shall we finish up!? </font>

<p><i>Battle</i>
<p><i>Battle ends</i>

<p><i>Dart goes to deliver the final blow to Lloyd, but Wink appears and runs between them.  Dart hits her and she falls into Lloyd's arms</i>

<p>Wink: Ah!! Please... forgive Lloyd.

<p><i>Later</i>

    <br><font color="#CC66CC">Rose: Albert, don't you need to be upstairs? Lloyd killed... Lavitz. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: I trust Dart with everything. He will bring us the right answer. </font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: I agree. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Haschel: I feel the same way. </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Ditto! </font>

<p><i>Meanwhile</i>

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: Why? Why did you shield me? I took many people's lives away for my own ideal, and the Divine Moon Objects. I used you. </font>

    <br>Wink: Even if it is the truth.... The fact that you saved me is still true! Besides, your death won't solve anything. Shana was taken away!

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Wh, what did you say!? </font>

    <br>Wink: By the man named Emperor Diaz. He told us to bring the three Divine Moon Objects and Lloyd and come to Vellweb.

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: Hmm, Emperor Diaz.... Finally he has begun to take action by himself. Now, take them to him. Even without me, my utopia will be built by Emperor Diaz. I completed all my tasks. Now, I have to settle up for what I have done so far. Kill me, and go to Vellweb! I dedicate my death to your departure! Is it out of pity? </font>

<p><i>Dart punches Lloyd, knocking him across the room</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Your death... won't bring... anybody who died back! Lloyd, I'm gonna make you see it through to the end! </font>

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: Passion.... Is this the power that drives them? </font>

<p><i>Later</i>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Shana was.... I see. </font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: When we go there, we can reveal the truth about the Emperor Diaz. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Whoever he is, he is dangerous. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Haschel: Besides! It is unforgivable to take our dear Shana as a hostage for his utopia or whatever! </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Exactly!! I'll beat him up whoever he is!! </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Queen Theresa, we are heading to Vellweb. And we need the Moon....</font>

    <br>Queen Theresa: I understand. I will let you have the Moon Mirror. Maybe we were in denial, surrounding ourselves with a comfortable life that really was stagnant. Yes, we Humans are not the only species... and all species were given life by Soa's plan. Now is the time to remember. The assault of the Divine Dragon, the existence of Winglies, the Divine Moon Objects, the utopia that Lloyd and Emperor Diaz desire.... And you, Dragoons. Everything is forcing us to remember it. As if things were manipulated by some great will called fate.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Even if so, I don't care. I will take Shana back even from "fate"! </font>

    <br>Queen Theresa: Miranda, you are one of the Dragoons. Go with Dart. Discover the meaning of the fate given by Soa.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Can I ask you one question? </font>

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: Yes. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Why did you save Wink twice? </font>

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: I had no reason for doing that. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I see. (Acquired Moon Mirror, Moon Dagger, Moon Gem) </font>

<p><i>Later, in the Snow Field</i>

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: I have something to tell you before we go to Vellweb. It's about Diaz. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: I see. With this blizzard.... It's not a bad time to take a break. </font>

<p><i>Kadessa, three years ago</i>


    <br>Diaz: ... Make the world regenerate.

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: Regeneration... of the world? </font>

    <br>Diaz: The world now is rotten, like a fallen fruit. It has the same smell as the world ruled by Melbu Frahma, the Wingly dictator. The world... where inertia is considered to be peace, and the easy path leads to devolution. The overture to the destruction has already begun.

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: "Devolution".... You are saying that is the reason why our magic power is deteriorating? </font>

    <br>Diaz: It is not only for you, Winglies. It is the danger all species are facing.

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: Now, how can we regenerate the world? </font>

    <br>Diaz: You Winglies are merely 107th in the plan. The great will, the creator Soa prepared the last... the 108th species. The last species is the last god, which will regenerate the world and lead us to utopia!

<p><i>Flashback ends</i>

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: "Count 108 years and when the Moon That Never Sets glares red, the Moon Child descends to the earth and shall give a holy blessing to the world." The "Moon Child" of this legend is the last species. It is the god that gives holy bliss to the world. </font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: That's not true. </font>

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: It is the truth. Then why does the Black Monster continue to kill the Moon Child? </font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: ...</font>

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: That devil wants to stop the evolution, after imagining himself scorched to death by the blessed light brought by the last species. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Lloyd. What is the relationship between the Divine Moon Objects you have been pursuing, and the birth of the Moon Child? </font>

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: The ancient Winglies feared their status as the supreme species would end, and sealed up the 108th species. They keys to dissolving the signet are the gem, dagger and mirror named after the moon. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: You were going to release the Moon Child, in other words, the "god", using the Divine Moon Objects. </font>

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: If I don't do it, somebody else will. Even the last god cannot escape from the fate determined by Soa. That's all that I wanted to tell you. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: If you desire a utopia, why did you take Shana away!? What is Shana to you!? </font>

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: All the truth will be told in Vellweb. </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Dart! The blizzard is over! </font>


<p><i>Sidequest in Fort Magrad</i>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: Hey! It's your fault, Dart! You slipped and we all ended up here! <i>(Spots a tomb)</i>Oh!? These are the ancient characters of the Winglies! Let me read it. "Winglies, ouch, mos." Oops. It's too hard to read. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Can you do better than that? There are some Human characters too....</font>

    <br><font color="#FF9933">Kongol: Gigantos too. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: ... ... I was bad at classics. Can you read some of them, Rose? </font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: "The cursed land where the decline of the Winglies began. Nobody is allowed to touch the door. The judge Nomos of the court of Zenebatos." </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: "Zenebatos"...? </font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: It was one of the most prosperous cities of the ancient Winglies. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: It's over there? </font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: No. If my memory is correct, over there should be Fort Magrad. But Vellweb is up there. Let's go back quickly. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: But, look at Meru. Let's give her a little break. You said it is Fort Magrad. Is this one of the Winglie's ruins too? </font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: No. It belonged to Humans. It was the land where Diaz declared war against the Winglies with tens of thousands of soldiers and seven Dragoons. I heard about it. </font>

<p><i>In the Capital of Vellweb</i>
    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: Here we are at the Capital City Vellweb. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: The seven towers.... Is Diaz waiting for us somewhere in there? </font>

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: That is the tower of the seven Dragoons. The throne of the Holy Emperor is underneath there. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: We are standing at the legendary place where Humans began their liberation. I wonder if it is an abominable place as well? </font>

    <br><font color="#003399">Meru: You think too much. It's the same as Kadessa, isn't it? When you drag the past around, you cannot walk anywhere. </font>

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: It is true. The Forbidden Land that was the royal capital of the Winglies. And this Vellweb is a mere historic ruin. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Yes. We can do nothing but settle for the present. </font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: Dart, look at that huge battery. Humans shot huge arrows from there. Aiming at the Tower of Flanvel. And back then, Humans thought this way. "That the arrow would not only shear the darkness that covers the earth. But also shear their corrupt hearts which were accustomed to being ruled." </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Why are you suddenly starting to say this? </font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: I don't know. I still cannot tell. But if we meet the guy who claims he is Diaz, I think we will find the reason. I'm speaking nonsense again. Let's keep going. A hero from history is waiting for us. </font>

    <br>Shirley: I have been waiting for you.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: You are Shirley!? </font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: Why? Why are you here? You ascended to heaven I thought....</font>

    <br>Shirley: Before that, I had something I had to take care of in here Vellweb. I couldn't leave the trapped souls alone in this world.

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: Are you talking about...?</font>

    <br>Shirley: Yes. The four souls of the Dragoons who lost their lives during the Dragon Campaign. Their souls were drawn to Mayfil. The gate of the inferno from which you can never return, is requesting the souls of the Dragoons.

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: The Death City Mayfil!? I thought it was destroyed! </font>

    <br>Shirley: I don't know how, but it is true that the gate of the inferno is open. Rose, I made their souls inert and anchored them in this place. But there is a limit to my power. After you meet Diaz, please visit this place again. And lead their souls to heaven.

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: The souls of the Dragoons are wandering somewhere in the towers. But, we have to take care of something else now. Let's go find Diaz. </font>

<p><i>Later, Dart and the others find Diaz and Shana</i>

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: Diaz. Here are all three Divine Moon Objects. There are no more obstacles to hinder our utopia. Release the girl. </font>

    <br>Diaz: Fine.

    <br><font color="#006633">Albert: Diaz!! What are you going to do with the Divine Moon Objects? </font>

    <br>Diaz: Didn't you hear it from Lloyd? My only desire is the advent of the last species.

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: If you are the true Diaz, you should know what that implies? </font>

    <br>Diaz: Total destruction.

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: Wha, what do you...?</font>

    <br>Diaz: Lloyd. Well done bringing me the Moon Gem, Moon Dagger and Moon Mirror. Now we can let the Virage Embryo, the God of Destruction, the last species we desire, the true Virage, arise. I will create the utopia you wanted, after the Virage Embryo purges the world.

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: Everything so far was an overture to that. Lloyd. He showed you a false utopia from the beginning. </font>

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: You deceived me. My utopia exists in the future of this world. What I desire is the creation of the future! Not the destruction of this world!! </font>

    <br>Diaz: I don't need you anymore. <i>(Attacks Lloyd, who falls into oblivion)</i>

    <br><font color="#999999">Lloyd: Argh!! </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Diaz!! What are you thinking!? </font>

<p><i>In an FMV, Diaz stands up and begins to unveil himself</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Father? </font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose (Dragon Campaign): Ahh! Zieg! Zieg!! </font>

<p><i>FMV ends</i>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Is that really you, Dad!? </font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: You died!! With Melbu Frahma on each other's swords!! </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Rose, what are you talking about? </font>

    <br>Zieg: Now, I can tell you everything. The beginning of the world was an absolute nothingness... darkness. The Creator Soa sowed a seed to the earth. This is the plan of Soa, that created all species. The birth of the Divine Tree.... Eventually, the fruit of the Divine Tree ripened and fell to the ground to fill the world with life. Gigantos from the 97th fruit. Minintos from the 99th fruit. Dragons from the 105th fruit. Humans from the 106th fruit. Winglies with magic power from the 107th fruit.... And at the end, the Virage Embryo, the God of Destruction was to be born from the 108th fruit. Soa desired the destruction and regeneration of the world by the Virage Embryo, the God of Destruction. However, 11,000 years ago, Winglies found out the tragedy waiting for them, and sealed the 108th fruit by separating the flesh and soul. The flesh of the god, the flesh of the Virage Embryo, was taken away from the Winglies as the Moon That Never Sets that glows in the sky. And the soul of the god was captured in the Crystal Sphere and Melbu Frahma kept it. Yes, to withdraw unlimited magic power from that, and to conquer the other creatures. However, even with unlimited magic power, the domination was not eternal. Humans arose with Dragoons in front. Nothing was their match because they obtained the power of the dragon. And finally, they drove Melbu Frahma into a corner. I felt certain of human... my victory. And it was in the next moment, the spell of petrification cast by Melbu captured me. I have waited for 11,000 years. Time, almost eternal, dissolved the spell of Melbu. And I was released from captivity. Days spent with Rose became the eternal past. And I lived as the father of Dart in this age. Until the tragic day in Neet.

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: I cannot believe it. </font>

    <br>Zieg: I am here, that is a fact.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Then, both Dad and Rose... are the heroes of the Dragon Campaign!? </font>

    <br>Zieg: Yes. But that's not all. Humans made a mistake. Silly Humans destroyed the Crystal Sphere, which was the container of the soul, along with the royal capital Kadessa. The Virage Embryo, the God of Destruction, was exultant. It could now be born. The free soul released from the Crystal Sphere started to wander. In order to go back to the Moon That Never Sets, to be born as the last god, and to destroy the world. The soul without a body possesses a human body and heads for the Moon That Never Sets, by repeating the transmigration every 108 years. You now know. The soul of the God of Destruction is the Moon Child. The truth of the Moon Child in the legend. "Count 108 years and when the Moon That Never Sets glares red, the Moon Child descends to the earth and shall give a holy blessing to the world." The "Holy blessing" is the destruction. The destruction is Soa's will. This is... the fate that rules the future of the world. But, there was one Dragoon who found out about it. In order to deter the birth of the God of Destruction, she has had to kill the Moon Children. By stopping her own time. She was even called a demon. That is the true self of Rose... the Black Monster!!

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Rose is... the Black... Monster? </font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: ...</font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Tell me it's not true!! </font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: The Moon Child has to be killed. And the people around it too, before they become the servants of the God of Destruction. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Neet... too!? </font>

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: For 11,000 years there have been no exceptions. </font>

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: God!!! Why you!! Why do you have to be the Black Monster!? </font>

    <br>Zieg: That's it.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: What are you going to do!? </font>

    <br>Zieg: Let me tell you one more truth. Rose, you thought the Princess Louvia you killed 18 years ago was the Moon Child, but it is not true.

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: !? </font>

    <br>Zieg: Louvia had a twin sister.

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: N, No!! </font>

    <br>Zieg: Shana is the Moon Child!! Shana is... the soul of the Virage Embryo, the God of Destruction!! I'll dissolve the Signet of the Moon That Never Sets, and cross it with the Moon Child. Now, I have everything in my hands.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Release Shana!! </font>

    <br>Zieg: And are you going to kill her? To save the world?

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: I'll kill her!! <i>(Goes to attack Shana, but Zieg blocks her attack with a shield)</i></font>

    <br>Zieg: This is the limitation of Humans.

    <br><font color="#660066">Rose: Zieg!! Why!? </font>

    <br>Zieg: All is the will of the creator, Soa. My hands start the world, and my hands end the world. Yes! Fate desires it.

    <br><font color="#990000">Dart: Dad!! Wait!! Shana!!</font>
